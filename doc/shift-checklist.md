## Check List

**Before the shift**

-   Activate your notifications to receive source and GCN GW events
    notifications on your phone or others

-   Make sure to finish the questionnaire sent by your WC and get their
    feedback.

**At the start of your shift**

-   Write on duty in #shifters channel in slack

-   Do immediate actions asked by the previous shifter during his
    transmission, If no transition action is stated, ask for a recap.

**During your shift, regular actions**

-   Check <https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars>, every 30 min and annotate
    all GCN GW event social pages in skyportal. You can also query
    skyportal to pick up the circular easily under properties tab by
    updating GCN circulars at the bottom of the page.

-   Update on-going GW counterpart candidate sources (from GCN
    circulars) in skyportal with the photometry, whether or not we are
    observing them with GRANDMA.

-   Contact telescope teams that do not respond to the previous shifters
    for any request of observations, contact new teams 2h before their
    night of obs, annotate the corresponding sources in #observations
    channel

-   Update all reporting in GRANDMA observations in sources and GCN
    event page

**In case of a new GW alert**

-   Check the status and write a report in #observations (with type of
    source, etc)

-   Add the name of the SXX in skyportal by going to the event page
    under GW/GRB/Neutrino and click on the '+' sign at the top right
    (next to interactions). Then add the corresponding SXX name tag to
    the event.

-   If no follow-up, remove GO GRANDMA and add Not-Icare

-   If follow-up, get ready to receive a notification from the telescope
    teams if they plan to observe or not, if they don't respond, contact
    them, annotate everything in GCN event page of skyportal

-   Tell the next shifters what they should keep track of for the next
    72h

-   Make sure the Science READY image (Calibrated images with WCS
    corrected) are uploaded in corresponding folder in owncloud

-   Make sure the photometry values are updated in skyportal under
    sources -\> click on the event link -\> scroll down to Photometry
    -\> click on 'upload additional photometry' and in owncloud folder
    as well.

-   Write the circular with your team, add all telescope teams in
    author + Follow-up advocates on duty + WC + core team. Only report a
    subset if there are too many observations and make sure to get
    validation from the core team

-   At the end, label the event STOP GRANDMA

**In case of a new GW counterpart candidate from GCN circulars**

-   If the source belongs to a significant GW alert ? If yes, link it
    with Skyportal and add the source. Go to Skyportal Dashboard -\>
    scroll to the bottom -\> under 'Add a Source', choose 'GRANDMA' for
    'share data with' drop down menu. Then enter the GW counterpart name
    given in the circular and its corresponding RA and Dec in the
    suggested format and click submit.

-   Add the corresponding photometry (in upload photometry option -
    refer to point 7 in previous section) of from report of the GCN
    circulars

-   If the sources do not belong to a significant GW alert (e.g the GCN
    GW alert is not present and we need to add it manually), add in
    #icare-skyportal channel in slack "to add the corresponding GCN
    events" (can be done only by admins)

-   Check TNS (<https://www.wis-tns.org/>) and add photometry data in
    'upload photometry' option

-   If ZTF, check Fink (<https://fink-portal.org/>) and upload
    photometry data in 'upload photometry' option

-   Check observability in source page in skyportal and contact the
    adequate telescope teams via skyportal follow-up request drop down
    menu (scroll to the bottom).

-   Annotate the report in skyportal during 3 days in GCN-GW event in
    skyportal page under 'interactions/social'

-   Make sure the Science READY images (Calibrated images with WCS
    corrected, bias and flat in fits) are uploaded

-   Make sure the photometry values are updated in skyportal under
    sources -\> click on the event link -\> scroll down to Photometry
    -\> click on 'upload additional photometry' and in owncloud folder
    as well.

-   Write the corresponding circular

-   After 3 days, label the event STOP GRANDMA

**At the end of your shift week**

-   Present + and - for the next FA team

-   Provide a report of the observations made and results

-   Fill the overleaf summary report
