## Communication between FAs

Communication between the FA's and the weekly coordinator is very
important. We encourage you to communicate frequently; not only with the
WC but with the other FA's. The weekly coordinator (WC) will create a
channel in slack for your group. If one of you cannot attend your shift
for a couple of hours or a day, you can ask for re-arrangement in that
channel from other teammates. If you need help, ask for help within your
team first before contacting a core member. If you see that the previous
shifter did not cover all the tasks, it is YOUR responsibility to fill
the gap and not let uncompleted tasks go to the next shifter. We will
give you some examples of transmission between FAs. These are optionals.

Note: As an FA, remember you need to annotate all events with new
circulars coming in skyportal.
