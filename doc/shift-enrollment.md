## Enrolling to Shifts

Note: The starting of each [weekly slot will be during the GRANDMA
telecon, on Thursdays at CET, and the week will have four slots of
shifts per day - one will be taken by the weekly
coordinator.]

So, 1 FA per shift plus the weekly coordinator. The slot of the weekly
coordinator will be used for doubling up with someone new for
training/support.

[The rota of the daily shift will be done at 00:00 CET, 06:00 CET, 12:00
CET, and 23:59 CET.]

[If you are new in GRANDMA and would like to better know the role within
the collaboration, Sarah made nice videos explaining them:]
