### Getting a GCN Account

1.  **Get a GCN account:** You also need to get a GCN account, GCN is
    the system used by researchers in astrophysics around the world to
    send out updates and circulars of the observations they have made,
    and any sources/data they find through their analysis. Like GRANDMA,
    there are other teams performing observations and so we use this
    system to stay up to date.

To get an account, please access this link:
[https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_circulars.html](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_circulars.html)

This process may take a while, and you need to add someone to grant you.
It can be
[sarah.antier@oca.eu](mailto:sarah.antier@oca.eu)

Activate the notifications on the circular, go to profile and turn on
the circulars button

### Connecting to GRANDMA's Owncloud

1.  [**Connect to GRANDMA owncloud:** Owncloud is like the google drive
    for GRANDMA; it is where we will store all the data from
    observations and any analysis of the alerts through our
    pipelines.]

Click the following link to connect to owncloud:

[https://grandma-owncloud.lal.in2p3.fr/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/Candidates/GW&fileid=1069468](https://grandma-owncloud.lal.in2p3.fr/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/Candidates/GW&fileid=1069468)

**If you don't have access**, it means you need to create an
"openstack" account. To do this, register at
[https://registration.lal.in2p3.fr/](https://registration.lal.in2p3.fr/)
and keep your password and your username.

-   ***If you have previously had an account and lost it or want to
    change your email address from a previous account:*** contact Gerard
    Marchal Duval
    \<[[marchal@lal.in2p3.fr]{.underline}](mailto:marchal@lal.in2p3.fr)\>
    otherwise proceed to the next step

As soon as you complete the above steps, [message in the #observations
channel]{.underline}:
"[@Sarah](https://grandmagroupe.slack.com/team/UFR2W0MQQ),
I registered in openstack, waiting for approval to join GRANDMA
owncloud"

![](./media/image11.png)

Sarah will grant you access (this may take 24 hours). You will have
access to GRANDMA's owncloud which you can open anytime using:

### Connecting to ICARE Skyportal

1.  **Joining I-Care/Skyportal:** we are going to use SkyPortal in our
    observational campaigns. This platform will be the interface we use
    to conduct the campaign, including receiving alerts, contacting
    teams, updating data, etc.

First, you need to subscribe and access it through the link:

[https://skyportal-icare.ijclab.in2p3.fr/](https://skyportal-icare.ijclab.in2p3.fr/)

As soon as you connect to it, you will see a page like the following one
(if not, click on Dashboard on the right sidebar). Your initials should
appear on the top corner on the right.

Ps: if you do not see this page, make sure to click on *Dashboard.*

[Setting your Profile in SkyPortal:]{.underline}

The next thing will be to activate the notifications you would like to
receive. As FAs you need to go to your profile to be able to change your
notifications preferences:

In your profile page, make sure **your email is correct** as you are
going to receive information about our campaign there.

On the "Notifications Preferences", you will have to indicate which

The options to select on this part will be different if you are an FAs,
observer or both.
