# Quickstart Checklist

## At the start of your shift

- Write on duty in #shifters channel in slack
- Do immediate actions asked by the previous shifter during his transmission, If no transition action is stated, ask for a recap.

## During your shift -- regular actions

- Check <https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars>, every 30 min and annotate all GCN GW event social pages in skyportal. You can also query skyportal to pick up the circular easily under properties tab by updating GCN circulars at the bottom of the page.
- Update on-going GW counterpart candidate sources (from GCN circulars) in skyportal with the photometry, whether or not we are observing them with GRANDMA.
- Contact telescope teams that do not respond to the previous shifters for any request of observations, contact new teams 2h before their night of obs, annotate the corresponding sources in #observations channel
- Update all reporting in GRANDMA observations in sources and GCN event page

### In case of a new GW alert

- Check the status and info (in GW alert or on Skyportal) and report in #observations (with type of source, etc.). Example:

NEW GCN circular from LVK: GW candidate S230927l  
BBH, Significance = 1, GRANDMA score = 1; 90% area = 1646.0 deg2 / 50% area: 326.0  
\-Distance: 3442.0 +/- 990.0 Mpc.

Based on distance and skymap size, check that you have labeled the event as Not I-care in Skyportal and removed GO GRANDMA

- **Add the name of the SXX in skyportal** by going to the event page under GW/GRB/Neutrino and click on the ‚Äò+‚Äô sign at the top right (next to interactions). Then add the corresponding SXX name tag to the event.
- **Add the same purple info above under Interactions on Skyportal**
- If no follow-up, remove GO GRANDMA and add Not-Icare
- **If follow-up, get ready to receive a notification from the telescope teams if they plan to observe or not, if they don‚Äôt respond, contact them, annotate everything in GCN event page of skyportal.**
- If the source belongs to a significant GW alert, add it on Skyporta: Go to Dashboard ü°™ scroll to the bottom ü°™under ‚ÄòAdd a Source‚Äô, choose ‚ÄòGRANDMA‚Äô for ‚Äòshare data with‚Äô drop down menu. Then enter the GW counterpart name given in the circular and its corresponding RA and Dec in the suggested format and click submit.
- Check TNS (<https://www.wis-tns.org/>) and add photometry data in ‚Äòupload photometry‚Äô option
- Check observability in source page in Skyportal and contact the relevant telescope teams via Skyportal follow-up request drop down menu (scroll to the bottom).
- Tell the next shifters what they should keep track of for the next 72h
- Make sure the Science READY images (Calibrated images with WCS corrected) are uploaded in corresponding folder in owncloud
- Make sure the photometry values are updated in skyportal under sources -> click on the event link -> scroll down to Photometry -> click on ‚Äòupload additional photometry‚Äô and in owncloud folder as well.
- Annotate the report in Skyportal during 3 days in GCN-GW event under ‚Äòinteractions/social‚Äô
- Write the circular with your team, add all telescope teams in author + Follow-up advocates on duty + WC + core team. Only report a subset if there are too many observations and make sure to get validation from the core team
- At the end, label the event STOP GRANDMA

## At the end of the shift week

- Pass on shift report to the next FA: ‚ÄúOne GW alert was received: S230709bi, was labeled as Not I-care based on distance mainly (5009 +/- 1547 Mpc) and skymap size (90% area: 2937.0 deg2 / 50% area: 835.0 deg2).  
    Filled the Overleaf summary page.  
    Only 1 GCN released during my shift: 34175.  
    No observations requested from the GRANDMA network, thus nothing to follow up on.  
    Wish good luck to the team in the rest of the shifts.‚Äù
- If there were observations being made and results to be reported, provide a report (of what has been performed and what still remains)‚Ä¶
- Fill the **Overleaf** summary report
