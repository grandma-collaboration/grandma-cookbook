The list of telescopes contact is available in this link :

In case of GW alerts, the telescope teams need to provide some feedback
whether or not they receive the plan well, if they plan to observe etc.
If you do not hear from them, please make sure to have some new
information 2h before their night.

You can see the list of telescopes in dark or sunlight in the main
dashboard of skyportal.

As mentioned previously, it is always ideal to have a small sky area for
the GW alert - so, if possible, it's good to wait for the 50% sky area
to activate observations for [BNS and BHNS GW alerts.]{.underline}

The sky localization of the GW alerts given by the LVK collaborations
looks like a banana shape (usually big) and for this reason, we do not
have only one localization of the source but several.

Telescope teams will them need to receive more than one localization to
perform observations to cover the entire sky map.

Depending on the FOV of the telescopes, the entire coverage of the sky
map might be very timing consuming and so, instead of giving regions
within the sky maps to observe, we select galaxies to observe within
it - galaxies targeting

One example of the logbook template you can use to keep track of
communication between your team.

Remember to Inform the next FA of the time in UTC which of the next
telescopes need to be contacted as night-time occurs for them.
