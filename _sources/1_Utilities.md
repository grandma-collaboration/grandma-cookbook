## 1.3 Getting a GCN Account

1. **Get a GCN account**: GCN (Gamma-ray Coordinates Network) is a system used by astrophysics researchers worldwide to send out updates and circulars of their observations and data findings. Like GRANDMA, other teams also perform observations, so this system keeps everyone up to date.

2. **To get an account**: 
   - Visit [GCN](https://gcn.nasa.gov/) (or for more detailed instructions, you can also check the old link: [GCN Circulars](https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3_circulars.html)).
   - Sign up with a new account.

   **Note**: The process may take some time, and you need to have someone grant you permission. You can ask sarah.antier@oca.eu or any other GRANDMA member who already has access.

## 1.4 Connecting to GRANDMA’s Owncloud

**Connect to GRANDMA Owncloud**: Owncloud is like Google Drive for GRANDMA; it is where we will store GCNs, all the data from observations, and any analysis of the alerts through our pipelines.

Click the following link to connect to Owncloud: [GRANDMA Owncloud](https://grandma-owncloud.lal.in2p3.fr/index.php/apps/files/?dir=/Candidates/GW&fileid=1069468)

If you don’t have access, you need to create an “openstack” account. To do this, register at [Openstack Registration](https://registration.lal.in2p3.fr/) and keep your password and username.

If you have previously had an account and lost it or want to change your email address from a previous account, contact Gerard Marchal Duval at [marchal@lal.in2p3.fr](mailto:marchal@lal.in2p3.fr). Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

As soon as you complete the above steps, message in the `#grandma`, `#observations`, or `#training` channel: “@Sarah, I registered in Openstack, waiting for approval to join GRANDMA Owncloud.”
