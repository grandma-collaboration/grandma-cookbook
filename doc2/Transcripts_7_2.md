### 7.2 How to register as a GRANDMA followup-advocate (shifter) ?

**(0:00 Introduction)**
Today I would like to show you how to sign on on shift. A shift is happening from Thursday to Thursday during six hours. So you can be shifter or follow-up advocate.

Shifter equal to follow-up advocate and follow-up advocate equal to shifter. So six hours on Thursday, six hours on Friday, six hours on Saturday, six hours on Sunday, six hours on Monday, six hours on Tuesday, and six hours on Wednesday. So in this video, I will show you how to sign on as to be a follow-up advocate.

This needs to be fitting what you have signed on in the LOI that your group leader has signed on for you. So let's share my screen and we're going to do that in Skyportal. 

**(1:02 Connection to Skyportal-Icare)**
So first you need to connect to skyportal.icare.egclab.en2p3.fr. So here you see ICARE, so Skyportal equal to ICARE, ICARE equal to Skyportal.

So when I refer to Skyportal, I refer to ICARE and when I refer to ICARE, I refer to Skyportal. ICARE is just a version developed for GRANDMA on the Skyportal system. So here I see the platform and I go to shifts.

**(1:38 Visualize Shift Page)**

So for the moment, I see that there is nothing in my agenda and this is completely normal. You can see the time, maybe if you're not in in France, you see or in Europe, you don't see the same time here. This is based on the local time.

So first you can see, you will click on show all shift and O4 is starting is starting on 24th of May. So we have shift before that is reserved for our weekly coordinator and then we will have shift, we will ask you to start register you as a (NIYATI) slots up to up to up to this one, Bella Papaya.

**(2:40 Register (join,leave))**
So how to sign on for a shift? So I choose for example, the NIYATI slot.

So for example, in France, I would like to perform my shift from 6pm to 12pm. So I will use register this one, this one, this one. And then next week, this one, this one, this one, this one.

So if I, if I sorry, if I would like prefer the slot from 12 to 6, then it will start on Friday because in fact, the shift starts at Thursday night. So how, so me, I decided that I would like to do an early shift in France. So starting at 6am to 12.

So I will go to NIYATI and I will click on join. And you see, my name is appearing. I don't know why as admin, but normally it's appearing as members.

So for example, finally, I'm too busy and it's not the week that I wanted, I will leave. And for example, I will choose to be with the Omega team, but still at 6 to 12. So I join, yeah, join.

And then my name appear as member admin. It doesn't matter if it is an admin or members. It's just because, it's just because sometimes the weekly coordinator did not create a shift.

So you need to be at admin, but it doesn't matter for the rest. You just need to be sure that your name appear here. So for example, I would like to start with Omega team run by Martin.

So I registered this and then I need to register all day, right? So the same time. So I cannot do that and then do that. No, only at the same time during all the week.

So tag, then join, then join, join. So if I am mistaken, I can click on here, join, join. 

**(5:14 Beginner option)**
So if I would like to say that I am beginner, I just have like, I'm beginner, right? It's better to add a comment.

For some of the slots, for example, some of the slots, for example, this one, it is specifically said that it's open for beginners. So you can register to this one because you don't feel capable to run your own shift. 

**(5:47 One shifter per slot)**
So compared to the last campaign here, there is only one member per slot.

You are not only, you are not two shifter per slot. You're only one, but you have friends from other slots and also your weekly coordinators that can help you. So yeah, it's going to be okay.

If you want to understand better about what is your role, I have done another video that you can look on YouTube. 

**(6:14 References)**
For the practice, you will be practice with your weekly coordinator. So here it is Kenza compared to here.

It is Martin. He will explain to you all of this later. We are still working on the techniques.

So which tool you're going to use as a follow-up advocate. So please be patient. You can, so if on your LOI, it has been said that you will be on more than one shift per three months, you need to register two times.

It's not necessary to only select, for example, for me is a six. So for example, I can choose another time. So for example, with Oleksandra and I will choose this time to register at night.

It is really depending on your calendar. Just be sure that when you have signed on, you're pretty clear about like that you really want this slot because otherwise it's a mess to organize. And we are very few people to organize GRANDMA.

So we really, really, with Iara, count on you to really do this task before 12th of May. Okay. So thank you so much and see you soon.
