### 7.5 GW alert and what to observe (telescope teams)

**(00:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone, so this is a video for the telescopes team to help them to understand how to observe a gravitational alert and the counterpart candidate associated to it. 

**(00:59 ways of receiving alerts)**
So in this video, we're going to see how we can receive the gravitational alert from the telescope team's point of view. So remember that there is another video for the follow-up advocate and the shifter that I have prepared for you a week ago.

So how we can receive the gravitational alert and what are the different types of sources that I need to observe. And in another video, so not this one, we're going to see how I can receive the plan and the plan team to observe during gravitational wave campaign. So in this video, which is like first the gravitational wave alert, how I can receive it, how I will be notified that I need to observe with my telescope right now.

So there is a different category, well, way to receive it. So you can receive on Slack and I will come back to that. You can receive independently via calls, via phone, via WhatsApp or via email or because you are not, you are sleeping or I don't know what's happened.

The FA, so the follow-up advocate, the shifter can contact you and say, hey guys, you need to observe straight away right now. So usually we would like that you are independent, right? So there is no need from case number three, but just by Slack or by call, WhatsApp or email. 

**(01:57 gwalert slack and type of messages)**
So we're going to see how to receive it. So it is easy via Slack, I just present Slack. You need to register to GW Alert to receive the notification that there has been an alert. So just I make a pause.

So remember that for GW Alert, there are different kinds of alerts, which means that you can receive different messages, several messages for the same event. So be careful. So I just remind that this is another video that I would like you to watch.

It's first, the message comes from preliminary and then go to initial and then go to update. So there are different messages because when we receive a gravitational alert in LIGO Virgo, we first produce a first like, yeah, the source can be here and then we refine our analysis. So regarding who you are and where you are over the planet, maybe you will observe at the time when the preliminary message is there, or maybe you will observe during the time of an initial.

**(03:14 go or no go)**
Okay, so I would like also to make a point that sometimes we receive a gravitational alert in Slack, but in fact, the localization is too wide. So we are not going to finally observe them within GRANDMA. So sometimes it's no GRANDMA because the alert is the BBH and the localization accuracy is not very good.
That's why the FA will not necessarily contact you or will not necessarily interact with you because it's not very interesting. So there are some preferences on how it is urgent to observe, how it is urgent to wake up as a telescope still. So it's mostly for the BNS and NSBH case.

It's mostly for events with distance located quite closer to us, like less than 200 megaparsec, and when the localization area is less than 200 degrees square. Okay, but as a telecom team, you can always observe. It's not, no, it's forbidden to observe.

You just use that to choose when you want to observe. And I would like to also make a point that because we are trying to practice, maybe it's better at the beginning to try to practice and observe some not urgent alerts because it's good for everyone to train. 

**(04:47 transition)**
Okay, so we are still on the gravitational wave alert section, and I would like to show you how to get this alert in Slack and in Skyportal and how to parameterize Skyportal.

So let me show you. So I go to first Slack. So as I said, you need to go to GW Alert.

**(05:33 slack gwalert channel)**
So in GW Alert, you have GW Candidate. For example, this is a message that you can receive. I have made another video to show you what does it mean.

But anyway, it's just a message that tells you that there has been a gravitational wave coming, and there is no plan here. You cannot access to the plan. After a while, so dozens of minutes, like 15 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes, you will also receive some kind of message, which means that the plan has been produced for GRANDMA.

It has been produced, and you can straight away observe it, pick up the observation plan and upload. But I will make another video for it. 

**(06:26 slack #skyportal-alerts)**
I also invite you to register to ICARE Skyportal. Here you will receive also the event. It is a duplication. It is exactly the same as GW Alert, but sometimes our systems are not very reliable, so it's better to register to ICARE.

**(06:47 not to type on gwalert channel)**
At the telescope scene, do not write on this channel. It is only for notification, so forbidden to write on this channel. If you have some questions, go to observation and not GW Alert and not ICARE Alert. I don't know where it is now. And not Skyportal Alert forbidden. 

**(07:27 register on icare-skyportal the notifications)**
Now I will go to our ICARE platform to help you to parameterize, so it's only in ICARE that parameterize this ICARE, so that you connect by Slack, that you can receive the plan by email, by WhatsApp, making your calling, etc.

And I will show you how to parameterize your ICARE Skyportal. So you go to your name, the profile, and then you go down. So me, I have registered my number, because I would like to receive it by WhatsApp or making a call or text message.

And you need, like me, to go to source and to GCN event. So to source me, I have selected Go Grandma high priority. GW Candidate, GW Consultant, Not GW Candidate, Stop Grandma and Go Grandma.

To have the same tag as me, you just need to select like this. And then it appears. And then, so for example, if you have already something, you click to update. And then you need to click to this button. So why? Because you see there that you will say, yeah, I would like to receive the message by Slack or by SMS. So this is more for the FA.

Anyhow, you can plug in here and by phone call if you want. So for example, by phone call, on shift, or you can define maybe your time slot or by WhatsApp. This is everything that you want. You do it like this. And then you really need to press the button update. Otherwise, it won't be recorded.

So then this is sources. So sources is not a gravitational wave. The sources are just like pointing, but we will see why it is very important to have it. And then to receive the first alert from GW event, you need to click on GCN event. So GCN equals GW equals GCN. Okay. So here, for example, I will create a new profile. So this is my new profile or like me, grandma, grandma go, for example. Even filtering. So we will do it together.

So everything that is LVC, not test because LVC retraction, perfect. Then I will select go-grandma, GW, perfect. And this is it for the moment. Maybe LVC. This is also great. Not maybe LVC. GW for grandma. Property nothing. And yeah. And then create. So I can create. You see, I have now grandma go. This is because I will receive the alert. I mean, I have parameterized this to receive the alert. 

And then I need to say how I'm going to receive the alert by email or message on Slack or by SMS. Yes. No. Sorry. By phone call on shift, for example. Or if you're telescope time, you just like say like your time slot. So for example, I have a shifter. I think this is in UTC. So you can, yeah, you can, for example, join my data. And then I click on, yeah, I think it's over. I think it has been taken. And this is it.

Okay. I also advise you to click on observation plan because you are telescope team. And again, you need to click on characteristic. So this is for understanding how I can receive the alert. Now I would like to come back to section number two. It's observation. Observation.

**(11:56 intro: what to observe in GW ?)**
 So as I said, remember in the beginning of my video, there is. So we are going to observe in the GW.


**(12:06 GW skymap recap)**
And this is another video that you can observe. But GW alert is not only a very accurate pointing. It's a very wide localization area over the sky.

So you cannot just only observe only one pointing. This is impossible. We need to have GRANDMA observing different parts of this localization area.

We call it, and the FA will call it, the sky map. Sky map is just a region of the sky to observe for a GW event. And you see this 90%.

It means that this contour within the sky, there is 90% chance that the event is contained in this contour. So me, imagine that I am on the FRAM team. I will receive different pointing.

One, two, three. You see in orange, in pink. Compared to TCR that we also receive other pointing.

This square represents the field of view of your telescope. That's why I'm asking you your size of your field of view. So in fact, what does it mean? It means that me as TARO, as TCA, I don't receive the same plan as FRAM.

So don't ask what is the plan or why I don't have the same coordinate as the others. Because in fact, each individual has different plan. Most of you have a smaller field of view.

So if we spend our time with your small field of view, scale the sky map, it will take ever and it is not efficient. That's why we will point a targeted galaxy that is located at the distance of the GW event. And again, it is for example in red by SAO.

And this is the galaxy targeting strategy. And you need to point this galaxy. So you have a galaxy in the center of your field of view. Sometimes the galaxy is not visible. So you see nothing. 

**(14:15 galaxies and tiling)**
So what does it mean as a reminder? So me, if I am in SHAO team, I don't have the same plan.

I have several coordinates. So not only one coordinate, several coordinates. And my plan is different than LEMAC observation plan. So it is not only, well, I don't see in GW alert, the coordinate. Because in fact, you have a different plan for each telescope. So this plan, we will pick up it in output. This is in another video. But this is very important. So I think you started to understand that there is a galaxy.

So maybe you will receive different galaxy with S. So several points for GW alert. So galaxy are here in this image, this red. If you have a narrow field of view, less than one degree. So this is most of the people. Or you have tilings with S. So which means that you have a wider field of view. And this, again, you will have different points to observe.

**(15:43 when to observe ?)**
So this search, so when you receive a galaxy targeting plan, or a timing plan, you need to do it in less than 24 hours. So imagine that GW alert comes. And this is a night, and it is cloudy, and you cannot observe.

Then if you say, yeah, I will observe the next day. It's already too late. Don't observe it anymore. Don't observe it, because it's not worth. You will need to go to the third category of sources. So first category, galaxy.

Second category, tiling. Some of you just received galaxy. Some of you received just tiling. Some of you can receive both. And this, the plan is less than 24 hours after the gravitational alert comes. And if you cannot observe them for any reason, the telescope is broken, or I can't have some plan, because sometimes the source, the localization is not accessible to your telescopes, you need to go for the search of GW source candidate, equal-equal transient.

And this search goes, you need to observe it in 72 hours, with a delay of 72 hours from the first message associated to this gravitational alert. 

**(17:14 Transient source candidates)**
So this is some candidate. So that I call GW candidate, and this is very important.

This candidate, you won't have it on Slack. You will receive it by email, because the FA, so this is an action of the FA, it will transmit you which candidate you need to observe. So this is something that the FA will tell you, either in observation, either you will receive an email. And this is very important, because in fact, you will, during an offer, you will really observe this GW source candidate. 

**(17:52 summary)**
So again, there is not only one GW source candidate, which means that, for example, if I am SHAO, I will observe a candidate that is different from UBE, or different from OPD, you know, so everyone has different things to do. This is very important, because you need to get it.

So I think I have done with all this first overview. And see you for the next video, when I will show you all the plan to receive the galaxy-targeting pointing and tying. So just as a recap, as a recap, as a recap.

So let me find my paper. So as a telescope team, you will receive different pointings, either observing galaxies, either performing tying. You need to do it within 24 hours.

And this, if you cannot observe, you need to say it in the Slack, on the observation, in Skyportal. I will show you how to do that just in a minute. And after, you move.

So if you cannot observe this promptly, you wait for message from the FA or by email to observe some GW source candidate. When the FA says stop, you need to stop everything, etc., etc.


**(19:36 interact with FAs)**
So for the candidate, you can have a message here from the FA to observe a source.

When you receive a GW alert, you can say like, so you need to say, you cannot say, I can't observe, right? This is not good. You say OPD, so you remind the name of the telescope for OPD one meter, cannot observe for today, you know, something like this, you know, so that the FA can record. Or if you are a bit, I mean, which is make easier everyone, is to directly go to the gravitational alert.

So for example, this is a gravitational alert. I go to social and I make a comment like OPD 1.5 meter, cannot observe this source within the next 24 hours. You know, this is a comment that I make, add comment, or something different.

So me as a telescope team, I have also TAO, so I said this to her as observe source XXX, etc., etc., to help the FA to understand what is your, what are you doing, you know, or plan or TCF plan, TCF plan to observe, to observe tonight. Okay, so thank you everyone. I will post that and if you have questions, please let me know and I'll switch to the technique straight away.

Thank you.
