### 7.3 Preliminary alert slack message

**(0:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone So this is the training for understanding what is the preliminary alert and we are going to see directly, we are going to go directly into GW alerts to understand what is going to return in slack and how urgent it is so let me share my screen. 

**(0:30 waiting alert)**
So as you see I am on GW alert channel and so here (#gwalerts) and I am the shifter tonight.  You see I have content behind me and I am waiting for an alert. so let's see what is going on.

**(0:51 new preliminary)**
So oh a new alert comes. I know it because it is bold in #gwalert and a new message arrived in the channel. So let's read together

**(01:05 GW name)**
GW Candidate, why candidate? because we never know if it is actually a true astrophysical event or not. Then, we have 230511CP which is the name of the gravitational wave candidates or the sources. The sources start by S, so it doesnt start with GW, it starts with GW only when confirmed. But, when it is a candidate, it starts by S…like SUPER! We got to observe! It's like super. Then, 230511CP, so this event happened on 11th of May 2023. This is a test event thats why the event is a bit older and then 

**(01:52 preliminary tag)**
I promise you it is a preliminary alert. So this is the first message that you receive from S230511CP. And number 1 because a preliminary alert type can be sent multiple times. The first time that the preliminary alert has been sent to you and to GRANDMA. So now it's time to make decisions.

**(02:20 detectors)**
 Then, you have detected by H1,N1,V1. Which means that this alert, the gravitational wave, has been detected by the three interferometers. H1 Huntford, N1 for Livingston and V1 for 
VIRGO. We are so lucky. Three interferometer means localizations would be very precise and it is an event that we need to pay attention. If it was like just H1, it is a one single interferometer detection so it is not so interesting.
  
**(03:00 trigger time)**
So then let's see about this section: time. There is a trigger time which means it's T0, when the two compact objects collided happened on 20230511 at 17:22 UT. Its always in UTC not in your local time. Here, you have the history of the event so we have 3 days three hours 55 minutes. This is very strange because it happened 3 days ago. 

The thing that you need to check first, if this event happened after the time you are in, otherwise it is a test event, it is something weird. When time since T0 for preliminary is above one day, which means that we don't care about it. So you need to check if here it is less than a day.

Again, this is an example, this is a test event, so it's not a good example. Anyway, so then we go to properties. 

**(04:26 properties)**
And the first thing that you need to check is the preferred category.

So BNS is for value neutral star, and it is a very interesting event. It is our best event. So here we need really to wake up GRANDMA and do our best to follow up.

Then you have a score. So the score is two, you have score zero.

**(04:52 score)**
so not good event, not very interesting. One, no, two, oh yeah, why not? And three is golden, okay.

So why it is score two? Because it is a BNS, so it is score two. And then you have has NS and has remnant, which means that has NS equal to one, so which means that there is a possibility that there is a neutral star. So it is, sorry, it is, maybe there will be some matter around and some brightness.

And has remnant equal to one would mean that we expect some matter and some light surrounding the event. So we need to follow up. However, the thing that you need to really check is preferred category BNS and GRANDMA score equal to two or above, two or three.

**(05:56 skymaps)**
Then you have the sky map area. So 90% credible region. This is something very important because when it is below 200 degrees square, so here it is 671, it is very important.

So here in this event is not so important because the 90% credible region is 670, so it's quite large to observe. However, the 50% area is below 200 degrees square. That's why GRANDMA’s score is still two and not one, but it cannot be three because the 90% area is not below 200 degrees square.

**(06:45 distance)**
Then we have the distance of the event. How far is the event? And the distance is about like 248 megaparsec. So when it is below 200 megaparsec, the grandma score becomes three, very important because the distance, the event is quite close.

So there is special below 200 megaparsec and above 200 megaparsec. 



**(07:16 noise)**
And then you have this indicator which tells you how glitchy the event is. So coherence between detector versus noise.

If it is above zero, above three, which means that there is low chance that the event, there is high chance that the event is astrophysical. And when it is below minus three, it means that there is high chance that the event is not astrophysical. 

**(07:51 links)**
And here you have, in measurement, you have access to the LIGO Virgo page, public page, and here access to our Skyportal page.

**(08:03 message for FA)**

I need to delete that. And then I provide you a kind of summary. So it is very interesting that, however, not when localized, yeah, it is above 200 megaparsec. 

And for our IS, it is above 200, sorry, it is above 200 degrees square and is above 200 megaparsec. So GRANDMA is going to compute the plan for the different telescopes. (8:33) And if the area, the 90% area is still, if we don't reach 50% of the area, which means that  it's not for us to follow up and the plan won't be sent to the telescopes.

So let me summarize.

**(08:56 conclusion)**
 I will stop the sharing. Let me summarize how it is urgent to follow up. So you need to check whether or not it is a BNS or NSBH category.

You need to check if the distance is below 200  megaparsec and if the area is below 200 degrees square. Okay. If it does not fill this criteria, then the score will be less than three, two, one, zero.
If it is this criteria, then the score will be equal to three. And you need to try to wake up all of GRANDMA. If the score is two, then the plan will be computed and you will have access to upload. And this will be my next video. Thank you.
