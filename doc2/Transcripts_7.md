### 7.1 What is the role of a follow-up advocate (shifter) in GRANDMA during the next GW observing run (O4)?

**(0:00 Global picture)**
Hello everyone, I would like to give a bit of explanation about what is a follow-up advocate within GRANDMA, a follow-up advocate or a shifter. So in fact, this is a big role in GRANDMA because it helps to notify the telescopes team when there is a gravitational alert, and to help them for pointing the telescopes at the correct location over the sky. So as a follow-up advocate or shifter, you need to guarantee that the alert has been well received and that they are performing good observations for the best scientific return of gravitational astronomy.

**(0:42 Organization)**
So to achieve this, in GRANDMA we have established like 24 hours and seven days schedule, that in fact is divided into four slots. So as a follow-up advocate, you operate during the week from Thursday to Thursday, during six hours, and then there is someone else that operates six hours, on six hours, and six hours. So you have also a weekly coordinator that helps to guide you, it's like kind of a mentor.

**(01:18 Task 1 GW alert)**
So the first task is a different task, and the first task is the gravitational wave alert, which means that you need to better determine whether or not it is a high profile alert or not. Because you will perform different actions if it is extremely important, or if it is just like routine gravitational wave alerts and we expect not so good scientific return compared to high profile.

 So how to determine that the gravitational wave alert is high profile? So number one, you need first to understand if the source is probably astrophysical or not, because sometimes the detector sends you some alerts, but in fact it has nothing to do with the sky, it's just not.

So you need to make sure that it is astrophysical. Second point is to make sure, I want you to check if it is a coalescence of a binary of two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole, because this is where we expect light coming, and so optical signature. Number three, you need also to check whether or not the event is close or far away.

If it is close, below 200 megaparsec, then it is high profile. Number four is to check in fact the size of the sky localization area. If it is below 200 degrees squared, then it means that it is also high profile.

So to ponder this, we can also see if it has been detected by one interferometer, two or three interferometers. So we will provide you some kind of score, automatic, from one to three. Three is like very extremely interesting, and one is, yeah, it is a gravitational alert, but it is you that is in charge to understand whether or not it is high profile or not.

So how are you going to receive this alert? Via Slack, via Skype or maybe by your phone, it is up to you. And this platform, Skyportal is hosted at ijclab.

**(03:52 Task 2 Notify)**
So now, task number two is to notify the telescope team. So what does it mean to notify the telescope team? Because in fact, the telescope team has already received the alert automatically and they are pointing to guarantee that they have received it and they are starting to observe if it is nighttime right now.

So after evaluating how it is interesting, you need to correspond with the telescope team. So the telescope team and you are going to exchange in the GRANDMA slack channel #observation. 

And in fact, you can delay your communication to a team that, for example, it is daytime, for example, in France, because there is no need to start prompt observation on the alert. But for teams, so if it is daytime in France, which means that it can be nighttime in China or in Australia, and then you need to make sure that they have started observation because we want best observation as fast as possible. 

You also need to take into account the observability condition for telescopes, which means that sometimes it is night, but they cannot observe the source because it is too low compared to the horizon or it is the best sources are only visible at daytime or it is not, its raining or things like this.

 So in fact, you need to reconcile when you contact the telescope team, how many points they can observe, how many observations they can make regarding the properties of the gravitational alert, and how it is urgent to perform observation. 

And when you have evaluated situation you can email the team just like, and you can even call them, welcome them to everything so that's, I mean, if it is urgent, you need to be there. That's why there is a swift 24 hours to make sure that the one that you need in short observation is starting to observe.

And it is essential to report in Skyportal everything in the lab book on Skyportal because then we need to have some feedback about the story and so on and so forth. And you also need to report to the next colleagues that will contact other teams when it will be nighttime. So, sometimes you will receive also, in the meantime that you're operating this task too, a message from the LVK that finally is not astrophysical so you need to send to all team yes stop observation because it's not astrophysical, and so you can do it here on Skyportal.

 So, the rules for contacting a telescope team is to contact them just before tonight so around 6pm at their local time. So sometimes you don't, you just don't need just to wait like this, there is a gravitational alert, you need to, you need maybe to do something from the previous alert that the other shift has done. So this is really a teamwork.

**(07:29 Task 3 Images)**
So text, three. Where is my paper, yeah. Text three is about image, which means that your task consists on once telescopes team are starting to observe to make sure that they have uploaded the image in our OwnCloud or in our Skyportal. And that's the image have the correct name, and the correct format. 

So why because then we will, I mean we will, we can rerun the analysis to understand like the brightness of the source etc etc so it needs to be in the good format, and it needs to be there. So the telescopes team have 24 hours from their observation to upload the image in our Skyportal. 

So, you need also to guarantee that they have also give you the photometric results, not only the image, the photometric results. For this, it's a science, you don't need to ask them on photometry or manual performance, but otherwise, they need to upload the photometric results. So, for this part is a bit tough so you can ask or can ask for assistance from to the weekly coordinator.

**(08:56 Task 4 Transient)**
So now, task number four is about transience, this means the toughest task as a follow up advocate, because what you need to know is that it's not only about like oh there is a gravitational wave and yeah we start observation, we have image making we detect new sources that can be the gravitational wave counterpart, and the job is done. 

No, because once the first step has been done, which is scanning, scanning the localization error box, then we need to find candidates. And this candidate can be either the gravitational wave counterpart, or the other things like supernova, or planet, or star birth, etc etc.

So, we need to define which one is the gravitational wave counterpart, and which are the other contaminants. And to do that, we need to point again the telescopes on this target. And what is your task, your task is to ask people to look at all the different sources, and to ask targeted observation to the team. 

In parallel, you're looking at what the other people are doing outside of GRANDMA, because they also come from gravitational wave follow up, and they will also detect transients. And so maybe you will find some of the GRANDMA telescopes to the transients from external team. So to do that, you will use some external tool like GCN, like you will scan the report by other team.
And you will also make, I mean, point the telescopes to the GRANDMA one. So really, your task is to guide the astronomer to point the telescopes at the right location for that transients.

**(11:05 Final Report)**
 So your final task is to produce a report, a report to the community, the GCN, but also a report to GRANDMA to see what's happened, etc etc.

 In this report, we need to show which observation has been made, do we detect transients, something that can be the kilonova or GRB associated to the gravitational alert, or if we did not detect anything, what is the sensitivity of our observation. 

We need also to report there the photometry from the transients sources, the candidate, whether or not it is spreading, whether or not it is not. This report will be done with the three other shifters and with the help of the weekly coordinator. 

**(11:59 Recap)**
So let me remind that task one is gravitational alert. Wonder if it is urgent to trigger telescopes or not. Number two, notify observers, either for rapidly scanning the localization, either to point the telescopes at interesting sources. Number three is to make sure that all the images are in upload and in Skyportal, to enable the scientific exploitation from this campaign. Number four is to filter the candidates to select the one that can be the gravitational wave counterpart. And final task is the report.

So thank you. If you have questions, of course, you can email me as always.
