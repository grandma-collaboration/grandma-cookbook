## 7.1 What is the role of a follow-up advocate (shifter) in GRANDMA during the next GW observing run (O4)?

**(0:00 Global picture)**
Hello everyone, I would like to give a bit of explanation about what is a follow-up advocate within GRANDMA, a follow-up advocate or a shifter. So in fact, this is a big role in GRANDMA because it helps to notify the telescopes team when there is a gravitational alert, and to help them for pointing the telescopes at the correct location over the sky. So as a follow-up advocate or shifter, you need to guarantee that the alert has been well received and that they are performing good observations for the best scientific return of gravitational astronomy.

**(0:42 Organization)**
So to achieve this, in GRANDMA we have established like 24 hours and seven days schedule, that in fact is divided into four slots. So as a follow-up advocate, you operate during the week from Thursday to Thursday, during six hours, and then there is someone else that operates six hours, on six hours, and six hours. So you have also a weekly coordinator that helps to guide you, it's like kind of a mentor.

**(01:18 Task 1 GW alert)**
So the first task is a different task, and the first task is the gravitational wave alert, which means that you need to better determine whether or not it is a high profile alert or not. Because you will perform different actions if it is extremely important, or if it is just like routine gravitational wave alerts and we expect not so good scientific return compared to high profile.

 So how to determine that the gravitational wave alert is high profile? So number one, you need first to understand if the source is probably astrophysical or not, because sometimes the detector sends you some alerts, but in fact it has nothing to do with the sky, it's just not.

So you need to make sure that it is astrophysical. Second point is to make sure, I want you to check if it is a coalescence of a binary of two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole, because this is where we expect light coming, and so optical signature. Number three, you need also to check whether or not the event is close or far away.

If it is close, below 200 megaparsec, then it is high profile. Number four is to check in fact the size of the sky localization area. If it is below 200 degrees squared, then it means that it is also high profile.

So to ponder this, we can also see if it has been detected by one interferometer, two or three interferometers. So we will provide you some kind of score, automatic, from one to three. Three is like very extremely interesting, and one is, yeah, it is a gravitational alert, but it is you that is in charge to understand whether or not it is high profile or not.

So how are you going to receive this alert? Via Slack, via Skype or maybe by your phone, it is up to you. And this platform, Skyportal is hosted at ijclab.

**(03:52 Task 2 Notify)**
So now, task number two is to notify the telescope team. So what does it mean to notify the telescope team? Because in fact, the telescope team has already received the alert automatically and they are pointing to guarantee that they have received it and they are starting to observe if it is nighttime right now.

So after evaluating how it is interesting, you need to correspond with the telescope team. So the telescope team and you are going to exchange in the GRANDMA slack channel #observation. 

And in fact, you can delay your communication to a team that, for example, it is daytime, for example, in France, because there is no need to start prompt observation on the alert. But for teams, so if it is daytime in France, which means that it can be nighttime in China or in Australia, and then you need to make sure that they have started observation because we want best observation as fast as possible. 

You also need to take into account the observability condition for telescopes, which means that sometimes it is night, but they cannot observe the source because it is too low compared to the horizon or it is the best sources are only visible at daytime or it is not, its raining or things like this.

 So in fact, you need to reconcile when you contact the telescope team, how many points they can observe, how many observations they can make regarding the properties of the gravitational alert, and how it is urgent to perform observation. 

And when you have evaluated situation you can email the team just like, and you can even call them, welcome them to everything so that's, I mean, if it is urgent, you need to be there. That's why there is a swift 24 hours to make sure that the one that you need in short observation is starting to observe.

And it is essential to report in Skyportal everything in the lab book on Skyportal because then we need to have some feedback about the story and so on and so forth. And you also need to report to the next colleagues that will contact other teams when it will be nighttime. So, sometimes you will receive also, in the meantime that you're operating this task too, a message from the LVK that finally is not astrophysical so you need to send to all team yes stop observation because it's not astrophysical, and so you can do it here on Skyportal.

 So, the rules for contacting a telescope team is to contact them just before tonight so around 6pm at their local time. So sometimes you don't, you just don't need just to wait like this, there is a gravitational alert, you need to, you need maybe to do something from the previous alert that the other shift has done. So this is really a teamwork.

**(07:29 Task 3 Images)**
So text, three. Where is my paper, yeah. Text three is about image, which means that your task consists on once telescopes team are starting to observe to make sure that they have uploaded the image in our OwnCloud or in our Skyportal. And that's the image have the correct name, and the correct format. 

So why because then we will, I mean we will, we can rerun the analysis to understand like the brightness of the source etc etc so it needs to be in the good format, and it needs to be there. So the telescopes team have 24 hours from their observation to upload the image in our Skyportal. 

So, you need also to guarantee that they have also give you the photometric results, not only the image, the photometric results. For this, it's a science, you don't need to ask them on photometry or manual performance, but otherwise, they need to upload the photometric results. So, for this part is a bit tough so you can ask or can ask for assistance from to the weekly coordinator.

**(08:56 Task 4 Transient)**
So now, task number four is about transience, this means the toughest task as a follow up advocate, because what you need to know is that it's not only about like oh there is a gravitational wave and yeah we start observation, we have image making we detect new sources that can be the gravitational wave counterpart, and the job is done. 

No, because once the first step has been done, which is scanning, scanning the localization error box, then we need to find candidates. And this candidate can be either the gravitational wave counterpart, or the other things like supernova, or planet, or star birth, etc etc.

So, we need to define which one is the gravitational wave counterpart, and which are the other contaminants. And to do that, we need to point again the telescopes on this target. And what is your task, your task is to ask people to look at all the different sources, and to ask targeted observation to the team. 

In parallel, you're looking at what the other people are doing outside of GRANDMA, because they also come from gravitational wave follow up, and they will also detect transients. And so maybe you will find some of the GRANDMA telescopes to the transients from external team. So to do that, you will use some external tool like GCN, like you will scan the report by other team.
And you will also make, I mean, point the telescopes to the GRANDMA one. So really, your task is to guide the astronomer to point the telescopes at the right location for that transients.

**(11:05 Final Report)**
 So your final task is to produce a report, a report to the community, the GCN, but also a report to GRANDMA to see what's happened, etc etc.

 In this report, we need to show which observation has been made, do we detect transients, something that can be the kilonova or GRB associated to the gravitational alert, or if we did not detect anything, what is the sensitivity of our observation. 

We need also to report there the photometry from the transients sources, the candidate, whether or not it is spreading, whether or not it is not. This report will be done with the three other shifters and with the help of the weekly coordinator. 

**(11:59 Recap)**
So let me remind that task one is gravitational alert. Wonder if it is urgent to trigger telescopes or not. Number two, notify observers, either for rapidly scanning the localization, either to point the telescopes at interesting sources. Number three is to make sure that all the images are in upload and in Skyportal, to enable the scientific exploitation from this campaign. Number four is to filter the candidates to select the one that can be the gravitational wave counterpart. And final task is the report.

So thank you. If you have questions, of course, you can email me as always.


## 7.2 How to register as a GRANDMA followup-advocate (shifter) ?

**(0:00 Introduction)**
Today I would like to show you how to sign on on shift. A shift is happening from Thursday to Thursday during six hours. So you can be shifter or follow-up advocate.

Shifter equal to follow-up advocate and follow-up advocate equal to shifter. So six hours on Thursday, six hours on Friday, six hours on Saturday, six hours on Sunday, six hours on Monday, six hours on Tuesday, and six hours on Wednesday. So in this video, I will show you how to sign on as to be a follow-up advocate.

This needs to be fitting what you have signed on in the LOI that your group leader has signed on for you. So let's share my screen and we're going to do that in Skyportal. 

**(1:02 Connection to Skyportal-Icare)**
So first you need to connect to skyportal.icare.egclab.en2p3.fr. So here you see ICARE, so Skyportal equal to ICARE, ICARE equal to Skyportal.

So when I refer to Skyportal, I refer to ICARE and when I refer to ICARE, I refer to Skyportal. ICARE is just a version developed for GRANDMA on the Skyportal system. So here I see the platform and I go to shifts.

**(1:38 Visualize Shift Page)**

So for the moment, I see that there is nothing in my agenda and this is completely normal. You can see the time, maybe if you're not in in France, you see or in Europe, you don't see the same time here. This is based on the local time.

So first you can see, you will click on show all shift and O4 is starting is starting on 24th of May. So we have shift before that is reserved for our weekly coordinator and then we will have shift, we will ask you to start register you as a (NIYATI) slots up to up to up to this one, Bella Papaya.

**(2:40 Register (join,leave))**
So how to sign on for a shift? So I choose for example, the NIYATI slot.

So for example, in France, I would like to perform my shift from 6pm to 12pm. So I will use register this one, this one, this one. And then next week, this one, this one, this one, this one.

So if I, if I sorry, if I would like prefer the slot from 12 to 6, then it will start on Friday because in fact, the shift starts at Thursday night. So how, so me, I decided that I would like to do an early shift in France. So starting at 6am to 12.

So I will go to NIYATI and I will click on join. And you see, my name is appearing. I don't know why as admin, but normally it's appearing as members.

So for example, finally, I'm too busy and it's not the week that I wanted, I will leave. And for example, I will choose to be with the Omega team, but still at 6 to 12. So I join, yeah, join.

And then my name appear as member admin. It doesn't matter if it is an admin or members. It's just because, it's just because sometimes the weekly coordinator did not create a shift.

So you need to be at admin, but it doesn't matter for the rest. You just need to be sure that your name appear here. So for example, I would like to start with Omega team run by Martin.

So I registered this and then I need to register all day, right? So the same time. So I cannot do that and then do that. No, only at the same time during all the week.

So tag, then join, then join, join. So if I am mistaken, I can click on here, join, join. 

**(5:14 Beginner option)**
So if I would like to say that I am beginner, I just have like, I'm beginner, right? It's better to add a comment.

For some of the slots, for example, some of the slots, for example, this one, it is specifically said that it's open for beginners. So you can register to this one because you don't feel capable to run your own shift. 

**(5:47 One shifter per slot)**
So compared to the last campaign here, there is only one member per slot.

You are not only, you are not two shifter per slot. You're only one, but you have friends from other slots and also your weekly coordinators that can help you. So yeah, it's going to be okay.

If you want to understand better about what is your role, I have done another video that you can look on YouTube. 

**(6:14 References)**
For the practice, you will be practice with your weekly coordinator. So here it is Kenza compared to here.

It is Martin. He will explain to you all of this later. We are still working on the techniques.

So which tool you're going to use as a follow-up advocate. So please be patient. You can, so if on your LOI, it has been said that you will be on more than one shift per three months, you need to register two times.

It's not necessary to only select, for example, for me is a six. So for example, I can choose another time. So for example, with Oleksandra and I will choose this time to register at night.

It is really depending on your calendar. Just be sure that when you have signed on, you're pretty clear about like that you really want this slot because otherwise it's a mess to organize. And we are very few people to organize GRANDMA.

So we really, really, with Iara, count on you to really do this task before 12th of May. Okay. So thank you so much and see you soon.


## 7.3 Preliminary alert slack message

**(0:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone So this is the training for understanding what is the preliminary alert and we are going to see directly, we are going to go directly into GW alerts to understand what is going to return in slack and how urgent it is so let me share my screen. 

**(0:30 waiting alert)**
So as you see I am on GW alert channel and so here (#gwalerts) and I am the shifter tonight.  You see I have content behind me and I am waiting for an alert. so let's see what is going on.

**(0:51 new preliminary)**
So oh a new alert comes. I know it because it is bold in #gwalert and a new message arrived in the channel. So let's read together

**(01:05 GW name)**
GW Candidate, why candidate? because we never know if it is actually a true astrophysical event or not. Then, we have 230511CP which is the name of the gravitational wave candidates or the sources. The sources start by S, so it doesnt start with GW, it starts with GW only when confirmed. But, when it is a candidate, it starts by S…like SUPER! We got to observe! It's like super. Then, 230511CP, so this event happened on 11th of May 2023. This is a test event thats why the event is a bit older and then 

**(01:52 preliminary tag)**
I promise you it is a preliminary alert. So this is the first message that you receive from S230511CP. And number 1 because a preliminary alert type can be sent multiple times. The first time that the preliminary alert has been sent to you and to GRANDMA. So now it's time to make decisions.

**(02:20 detectors)**
 Then, you have detected by H1,N1,V1. Which means that this alert, the gravitational wave, has been detected by the three interferometers. H1 Huntford, N1 for Livingston and V1 for 
VIRGO. We are so lucky. Three interferometer means localizations would be very precise and it is an event that we need to pay attention. If it was like just H1, it is a one single interferometer detection so it is not so interesting.
  
**(03:00 trigger time)**
So then let's see about this section: time. There is a trigger time which means it's T0, when the two compact objects collided happened on 20230511 at 17:22 UT. Its always in UTC not in your local time. Here, you have the history of the event so we have 3 days three hours 55 minutes. This is very strange because it happened 3 days ago. 

The thing that you need to check first, if this event happened after the time you are in, otherwise it is a test event, it is something weird. When time since T0 for preliminary is above one day, which means that we don't care about it. So you need to check if here it is less than a day.

Again, this is an example, this is a test event, so it's not a good example. Anyway, so then we go to properties. 

**(04:26 properties)**
And the first thing that you need to check is the preferred category.

So BNS is for value neutral star, and it is a very interesting event. It is our best event. So here we need really to wake up GRANDMA and do our best to follow up.

Then you have a score. So the score is two, you have score zero.

**(04:52 score)**
so not good event, not very interesting. One, no, two, oh yeah, why not? And three is golden, okay.

So why it is score two? Because it is a BNS, so it is score two. And then you have has NS and has remnant, which means that has NS equal to one, so which means that there is a possibility that there is a neutral star. So it is, sorry, it is, maybe there will be some matter around and some brightness.

And has remnant equal to one would mean that we expect some matter and some light surrounding the event. So we need to follow up. However, the thing that you need to really check is preferred category BNS and GRANDMA score equal to two or above, two or three.

**(05:56 skymaps)**
Then you have the sky map area. So 90% credible region. This is something very important because when it is below 200 degrees square, so here it is 671, it is very important.

So here in this event is not so important because the 90% credible region is 670, so it's quite large to observe. However, the 50% area is below 200 degrees square. That's why GRANDMA’s score is still two and not one, but it cannot be three because the 90% area is not below 200 degrees square.

**(06:45 distance)**
Then we have the distance of the event. How far is the event? And the distance is about like 248 megaparsec. So when it is below 200 megaparsec, the grandma score becomes three, very important because the distance, the event is quite close.

So there is special below 200 megaparsec and above 200 megaparsec. 

**(07:16 noise)**
And then you have this indicator which tells you how glitchy the event is. So coherence between detector versus noise.

If it is above zero, above three, which means that there is low chance that the event, there is high chance that the event is astrophysical. And when it is below minus three, it means that there is high chance that the event is not astrophysical. 

**(07:51 links)**
And here you have, in measurement, you have access to the LIGO Virgo page, public page, and here access to our Skyportal page.

**(08:03 message for FA)**

I need to delete that. And then I provide you a kind of summary. So it is very interesting that, however, not when localized, yeah, it is above 200 megaparsec. 

And for our IS, it is above 200, sorry, it is above 200 degrees square and is above 200 megaparsec. So GRANDMA is going to compute the plan for the different telescopes. (8:33) And if the area, the 90% area is still, if we don't reach 50% of the area, which means that  it's not for us to follow up and the plan won't be sent to the telescopes.

So let me summarize.

**(08:56 conclusion)**
 I will stop the sharing. Let me summarize how it is urgent to follow up. So you need to check whether or not it is a BNS or NSBH category.

You need to check if the distance is below 200  megaparsec and if the area is below 200 degrees square. Okay. If it does not fill this criteria, then the score will be less than three, two, one, zero.
If it is this criteria, then the score will be equal to three. And you need to try to wake up all of GRANDMA. If the score is two, then the plan will be computed and you will have access to upload. And this will be my next video. Thank you.


## 7.4 Notify telescope teams and Observation plan

**(00:00 intro)**
Hello everyone, so today we're going to talk about step 2, so notify. Last time we talked about the GW alert, one we're going to observe in GRANDMA, which type of alert, and today we're going to show how to notify the telescopes and how to produce the plan. So first I would like to come back about the gravitational wave area.

**(00:29 GW skymap: 90 c.r)**
So here you have, for example, the sky, and LIGO-VIRGO gives a 90% credible area here in black. A 90% credible area or 90% credible region of the sky map is the fact that in this area over the sky, there is 90% of chance that the source is located within this region, and there is 10% of the chance that the source is finally not in this region. So 90% area means that there is a control that defines the 90% of chance that the source is within this area.
50% credible region for the sky map, it means that there is 50% of the chance that the source is within this area, and 50% outside. So the sky map is just like the area of the sky, delimited by a certain confidence number. So remember after last time, after last courses, so we said that we can observe with GRANDMA BNS and NSBH events, when the event is located below 200 MPS, and for an area of the 90% credible region within 200°², so which means that this area, 90% credible region, is less than 200°².
So imagine that this region is several dozen of degrees squared, 100 or 200°², so you cannot point with one telescope something. 

**(00:29 GW skymap: 90 c.r)**
So that's why we will pave the sky, so this is again in black my 90% credible area in control, and we're going to pave the sky, so we have a wide field of view, this is a field of view from a telescope, this is a field of view from another telescope, all the telescopes, they don't have the same field of view, and we're going to pave the sky with all our telescopes in GRANDMA So for example, let's see TCR, which is from the TARO collaboration, it will look at this region of the sky, so we just take a picture from this region here, and then another picture here, which means that for a gravitational alert, we don't give only one pointing, but several pointing, for example, several pointing for this one and this one.
And for FRAM, so another telescope within GRANDMA, it will observe that region, that region, that region, so that we will cover all the sky map. So for the wide field of view, we're able to rapidly pave the sky map, the 90% credible region, but when you have a smaller field of view, you cannot pave because it's going to take a lot of time. That's why we give some interesting galaxies to observe, so here in red, I'm putting red in my picture, for example, giving pointing to SHAO, and this is what we call galaxy targeting compared to tiling.And so then we will fix on region, on galaxies that are located at a distance given by the gravitational wave alert. 
(04:08 Observation plan)
So here, when we talk about giving the observation plan to the telescope's team, it's, for example, galaxy at a certain distance, sorry, and different pointing, which means that if me, I am in SHAO team, and my friend in FRAM and I won't receive, sorry, the same plan with SHAO and with LEMAC. So which means as a follow-up advocate, you need to be very long, but because it's not like GRB or Kilonova, SHAO team, this telescope will receive different targets, so not only one, one, two, three, and LEMAC will receive another type of target.
So when someone said to you, give me the list, you need to provide the corresponding list according to the telescopes, okay? 

**(05:06 Tiling and galaxy targeting)**
So now I would like to give a bit some lessons. So I think you got it. So we have one strategy, which is tiling, and the other one, which is, sorry, galaxy targeting.
Maybe it's like this, because the camera is not standing. Okay, so tiling and galaxy targeting. So once more, oops, tiling and galaxy targeting.
This is not the same strategy. 

**(05:41 Tiling)**
So for the tiling, we have a few telescopes in GRANDMA, quite a number. So we have the TARO collaboration with TCH, TRO, and TCA. They come from TARO. One good news is that when the gravitational wave comes, and we are in the criteria that we saw last time, the plan is sent automatically. So as a follow-up advocate, you just need to check if in Sky Portal, TARO is observing or there is something wrong. We have another group that is called FRAM. So I will write it so that you get, you remember. So FRAM got two telescopes. Again, they are going to observe automatically, so you don't need to do anything unless there is something wrong. For example, you don't see any tiling, any tides, any pointing in Sky Portal, so you can come back, Sergey. For this TARO, you can contact Alain, Alain Klotz, or me, so the PI or the co-PI.
And then we have also access to other facilities. I won't talk about ZTF for the moment. Let's talk to OAG or CFHT. They are wide fields. They can do tiling, but we have only very few time. That's why if there is very interesting alert, discuss with the weekly coordinator.
Maybe we will activate observation with OAG or observation with CFHT. CFHT is me, OIG is Antonio. So if your weekly coordinator thinks that it's very important to observe, then we will compute.
In fact, the plan is already computed, but we will send this back to OAG and CFHT telescopes. So I hope that you listen to me, because this is the tiling, tiling telescopes.

**(07:46 Galaxy Targeting)**
 Now, about the galaxy targeting. So there are many telescopes in GRANDMA that can do galaxy targeting. The narrow field of view, so below 1° square, that they will observe if the gravitational wave is below 200° square. And so the list is a lot of telescopes.
So the list is a lot of telescopes as LEMAC. And here, your job as follow-up advocate is really to make sure that the team, they have understood to point, because it's not automatic. They won't perform, most of them, they won't receive the alert and the telescope will point automatically.
You need to make sure that they have received their list of targets, because remember, it's not one unique list of targets, it's several lists of targets. So you need to make sure that, for example, that you need to observe pointing 1 and 3, and, for example, LEMAC pointing 2 and 4. So this is your job. 

**(08:50 Notify)**
So that's why we come back to your job, which is notify. And for the tiling, it's mostly to check if TARO and FRAM are starting the follow-up, or in case of interesting, notify Antonio and I to make some dedicated follow-up. For the galaxy targeting, here is more, you need to engage more, because you need to notify the team, make sure that they have understood that they will be, they have well received their plan. And now, in the second part of this video, we're going to see in Skyportal and in Slack and in OwnCloud how to receive this plan. So gravitational alert. 

**(09:45 Slack obs plan)**
So remember, let's look at this channel, gravitational alert. So remember on lesson 1, you had this GW candidate coming.
We tried to understand all these parameters. And after a while, so you see the alert was received at 8.05 for my local time. And after a while, you will receive this message connected to, for example, 23.01.11 CP.
So three minutes, sometimes it's 10 minutes. Okay, so don't worry, you need to really wait for. And this is tiling.
So we talk about tiling. And here you can see that the telescopes for which the plan has been computed. So 20 fields, which means that we will give them 20 observations to do.
And it corresponds to 40%, for example, for TCH of the credible region, for TRO 27% of the credible region, FSU Auger 12%, and TCA only 1%, and FSU only 5%. 

**(10:56 tiling joint area)**
So if you make the sum of all the percentage that they contain the sources, in fact, you arrive to a probability area of 70% for a total of coverage of the sky of 487 degrees square. So this is quite good.

**(11:31 galaxy targeting slack)**
And also because we can compute this, for example, I give an example about computation of the galaxy targeting. So we will also receive a message. So here I just put one telescope for the test, but you can also receive all the fields.
So remember here at the center of each field, there is the galaxy. Compared to here, there is nothing about galaxy. I think you get it.
(12:07 report on skyportal)
So now I will go to Skyportal. So you will receive the alert in Skyportal. Okay, so this is Skyportal.
Imagine that this is the event. And what you need to do is to go to social and say, so I receive, for example, the alert on Slack, plans produce for yada yada. And then you check like, this is a comment.
And then you receive, you can say like, TCA, hey, as observed, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure that all the things that you have written previously in the logbook will be captured in Skyportal. 

**(13:17 owncloud intro)**
So now I go to, I come back to this gravitational alert. So I go to our enclose.
So you need to have access to enclose. I go, for example, to candidates. So now GW, this is 11 CP.
Sorry, I am a bit ill. And we're going to explore the different folders of OwnCloud because we need to check that. So for example, you have a real event. 

**(13:56 vo events)**
So I will make maybe a video about it. But this is preliminary one because remember that we are at preliminary one here in my example. Sorry.
So we are at preliminary run and you can see, in fact, the message that were sent to the different telescopes automatically. So this is really for automatic telescopes. In this preliminary, you can see, in fact, the different pointing provided to the telescopes.

**(14:36 gwemopt and txt plans)**
So what is interesting is to go to GWEMOPT for you. I go to preliminary. So we have different two type of plans.
This is where we can see the plan. So I go to tiling. And again, you have, in fact, the pointing given to the different telescopes.
So here is TCH. It is called TCH, right? There is 20 fields. Oh, yeah, because remember we said that we are going to give 20 fields.
And so this is the tile ID. So the tile within Skyportal. The ranking, 1, 2, 3. So sometimes the telescopes, they will give you this number or this number.
In Skyportal, I think this is more this number. And then this is the coordinates given to a telescope and the probability. So the ranking.
So you see, the first one has more probabilities than the last one. And so if someone asks you the plan, here it is. It is in the name of the gravitational alert, GWEMOPT, the type of the alert, and tiling. So if someone asks you are the tile and there are different alerts, for example, we are already at the initial. You don't provide preliminary. You give the observation plan corresponding to the most updated sky map.
Okay? So, I mean, it sounds reasonable. So for the galaxy, sorry, for the other teams, for example, for the galaxy targeting. So here in NEMAC, again, you can give if the telescopes team doesn't know where is the plan.
And to help them, we can give this coordinate. So you need to observe that and that and that, et cetera, et cetera. So this is the plan to give to the telescopes team.

**(16:39 provide assistance teams)**
What you need to do, as always, is to go to #observation, say, Hi, we have received an alert. And then, so hi, we have hi channel. We have received an alert.
And then, you contact the team regarding if it is night or not. So to determine if it is night or not. So you look at this plan.

**(17:09 skyportal visibility telescopes)**
You know, I have a map. And you can see that VIRT, OPD, TCH, PRAM, et cetera, they can observe right now. So you will first bother them because it is now this team.
And it is important in Sky Portal, in here, to say, I have contacted nananinanana teams. Because for the next shifter, he will contact the one when it is nighttime. You know, so we don't contact all the team when it is daytime.
Remember, we contact them two hours before it is nighttime. So with Sky Portal, it will really help you to understand which team are during night and daytime. Let me remember what I need to say to you. I think it's done.

**(18:17 skymap plot)**
 So I'm just coming back here. Because in Tiling, for example, there is plots.
And there are interesting plots. So for example, type coverage, EMT mock. You can see, in fact, the probabilities, the sky map.
And you can see the different tilings, what it gives you. So for example, you can see over time which one contributes regarding the pointing. And you can see that it's very joint.
So for example, here, TAO you know, observe some tile, whereas the others are observing something else. So you can check, for example, to understand better the plan about these different plots that you have on the cloud. To understand better what it is going on.
So in case that you are lost, you need to contact your coordinator. And this is it. 

**(19:23 bye)**
So thank you to have listened to me.
And I will make an exercise for you straight away. Thank you.


### 7.5 GW alert and what to observe (telescope teams)

**(00:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone, so this is a video for the telescopes team to help them to understand how to observe a gravitational alert and the counterpart candidate associated to it. 

**(00:59 ways of receiving alerts)**
So in this video, we're going to see how we can receive the gravitational alert from the telescope team's point of view. So remember that there is another video for the follow-up advocate and the shifter that I have prepared for you a week ago.

So how we can receive the gravitational alert and what are the different types of sources that I need to observe. And in another video, so not this one, we're going to see how I can receive the plan and the plan team to observe during gravitational wave campaign. So in this video, which is like first the gravitational wave alert, how I can receive it, how I will be notified that I need to observe with my telescope right now.

So there is a different category, well, way to receive it. So you can receive on Slack and I will come back to that. You can receive independently via calls, via phone, via WhatsApp or via email or because you are not, you are sleeping or I don't know what's happened.

The FA, so the follow-up advocate, the shifter can contact you and say, hey guys, you need to observe straight away right now. So usually we would like that you are independent, right? So there is no need from case number three, but just by Slack or by call, WhatsApp or email. 

**(01:57 gwalert slack and type of messages)**
So we're going to see how to receive it. So it is easy via Slack, I just present Slack. You need to register to GW Alert to receive the notification that there has been an alert. So just I make a pause.

So remember that for GW Alert, there are different kinds of alerts, which means that you can receive different messages, several messages for the same event. So be careful. So I just remind that this is another video that I would like you to watch.

It's first, the message comes from preliminary and then go to initial and then go to update. So there are different messages because when we receive a gravitational alert in LIGO Virgo, we first produce a first like, yeah, the source can be here and then we refine our analysis. So regarding who you are and where you are over the planet, maybe you will observe at the time when the preliminary message is there, or maybe you will observe during the time of an initial.

**(03:14 go or no go)**
Okay, so I would like also to make a point that sometimes we receive a gravitational alert in Slack, but in fact, the localization is too wide. So we are not going to finally observe them within GRANDMA. So sometimes it's no GRANDMA because the alert is the BBH and the localization accuracy is not very good.
That's why the FA will not necessarily contact you or will not necessarily interact with you because it's not very interesting. So there are some preferences on how it is urgent to observe, how it is urgent to wake up as a telescope still. So it's mostly for the BNS and NSBH case.

It's mostly for events with distance located quite closer to us, like less than 200 megaparsec, and when the localization area is less than 200 degrees square. Okay, but as a telecom team, you can always observe. It's not, no, it's forbidden to observe.

You just use that to choose when you want to observe. And I would like to also make a point that because we are trying to practice, maybe it's better at the beginning to try to practice and observe some not urgent alerts because it's good for everyone to train. 

**(04:47 transition)**
Okay, so we are still on the gravitational wave alert section, and I would like to show you how to get this alert in Slack and in Skyportal and how to parameterize Skyportal.

So let me show you. So I go to first Slack. So as I said, you need to go to GW Alert.

**(05:33 slack gwalert channel)**
So in GW Alert, you have GW Candidate. For example, this is a message that you can receive. I have made another video to show you what does it mean.

But anyway, it's just a message that tells you that there has been a gravitational wave coming, and there is no plan here. You cannot access to the plan. After a while, so dozens of minutes, like 15 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes, you will also receive some kind of message, which means that the plan has been produced for GRANDMA.

It has been produced, and you can straight away observe it, pick up the observation plan and upload. But I will make another video for it. 

**(06:26 slack #skyportal-alerts)**
I also invite you to register to ICARE Skyportal. Here you will receive also the event. It is a duplication. It is exactly the same as GW Alert, but sometimes our systems are not very reliable, so it's better to register to ICARE.

**(06:47 not to type on gwalert channel)**
At the telescope scene, do not write on this channel. It is only for notification, so forbidden to write on this channel. If you have some questions, go to observation and not GW Alert and not ICARE Alert. I don't know where it is now. And not Skyportal Alert forbidden. 

**(07:27 register on icare-skyportal the notifications)**
Now I will go to our ICARE platform to help you to parameterize, so it's only in ICARE that parameterize this ICARE, so that you connect by Slack, that you can receive the plan by email, by WhatsApp, making your calling, etc.

And I will show you how to parameterize your ICARE Skyportal. So you go to your name, the profile, and then you go down. So me, I have registered my number, because I would like to receive it by WhatsApp or making a call or text message.

And you need, like me, to go to source and to GCN event. So to source me, I have selected Go Grandma high priority. GW Candidate, GW Consultant, Not GW Candidate, Stop Grandma and Go Grandma.

To have the same tag as me, you just need to select like this. And then it appears. And then, so for example, if you have already something, you click to update. And then you need to click to this button. So why? Because you see there that you will say, yeah, I would like to receive the message by Slack or by SMS. So this is more for the FA.

Anyhow, you can plug in here and by phone call if you want. So for example, by phone call, on shift, or you can define maybe your time slot or by WhatsApp. This is everything that you want. You do it like this. And then you really need to press the button update. Otherwise, it won't be recorded.

So then this is sources. So sources is not a gravitational wave. The sources are just like pointing, but we will see why it is very important to have it. And then to receive the first alert from GW event, you need to click on GCN event. So GCN equals GW equals GCN. Okay. So here, for example, I will create a new profile. So this is my new profile or like me, grandma, grandma go, for example. Even filtering. So we will do it together.

So everything that is LVC, not test because LVC retraction, perfect. Then I will select go-grandma, GW, perfect. And this is it for the moment. Maybe LVC. This is also great. Not maybe LVC. GW for grandma. Property nothing. And yeah. And then create. So I can create. You see, I have now grandma go. This is because I will receive the alert. I mean, I have parameterized this to receive the alert. 

And then I need to say how I'm going to receive the alert by email or message on Slack or by SMS. Yes. No. Sorry. By phone call on shift, for example. Or if you're telescope time, you just like say like your time slot. So for example, I have a shifter. I think this is in UTC. So you can, yeah, you can, for example, join my data. And then I click on, yeah, I think it's over. I think it has been taken. And this is it.

Okay. I also advise you to click on observation plan because you are telescope team. And again, you need to click on characteristic. So this is for understanding how I can receive the alert. Now I would like to come back to section number two. It's observation. Observation.

**(11:56 intro: what to observe in GW ?)**
 So as I said, remember in the beginning of my video, there is. So we are going to observe in the GW.


**(12:06 GW skymap recap)**
And this is another video that you can observe. But GW alert is not only a very accurate pointing. It's a very wide localization area over the sky.

So you cannot just only observe only one pointing. This is impossible. We need to have GRANDMA observing different parts of this localization area.

We call it, and the FA will call it, the sky map. Sky map is just a region of the sky to observe for a GW event. And you see this 90%.

It means that this contour within the sky, there is 90% chance that the event is contained in this contour. So me, imagine that I am on the FRAM team. I will receive different pointing.

One, two, three. You see in orange, in pink. Compared to TCR that we also receive other pointing.

This square represents the field of view of your telescope. That's why I'm asking you your size of your field of view. So in fact, what does it mean? It means that me as TARO, as TCA, I don't receive the same plan as FRAM.

So don't ask what is the plan or why I don't have the same coordinate as the others. Because in fact, each individual has different plan. Most of you have a smaller field of view.

So if we spend our time with your small field of view, scale the sky map, it will take ever and it is not efficient. That's why we will point a targeted galaxy that is located at the distance of the GW event. And again, it is for example in red by SAO.

And this is the galaxy targeting strategy. And you need to point this galaxy. So you have a galaxy in the center of your field of view. Sometimes the galaxy is not visible. So you see nothing. 

**(14:15 galaxies and tiling)**
So what does it mean as a reminder? So me, if I am in SHAO team, I don't have the same plan.

I have several coordinates. So not only one coordinate, several coordinates. And my plan is different than LEMAC observation plan. So it is not only, well, I don't see in GW alert, the coordinate. Because in fact, you have a different plan for each telescope. So this plan, we will pick up it in output. This is in another video. But this is very important. So I think you started to understand that there is a galaxy.

So maybe you will receive different galaxy with S. So several points for GW alert. So galaxy are here in this image, this red. If you have a narrow field of view, less than one degree. So this is most of the people. Or you have tilings with S. So which means that you have a wider field of view. And this, again, you will have different points to observe.

**(15:43 when to observe ?)**
So this search, so when you receive a galaxy targeting plan, or a timing plan, you need to do it in less than 24 hours. So imagine that GW alert comes. And this is a night, and it is cloudy, and you cannot observe.

Then if you say, yeah, I will observe the next day. It's already too late. Don't observe it anymore. Don't observe it, because it's not worth. You will need to go to the third category of sources. So first category, galaxy.

Second category, tiling. Some of you just received galaxy. Some of you received just tiling. Some of you can receive both. And this, the plan is less than 24 hours after the gravitational alert comes. And if you cannot observe them for any reason, the telescope is broken, or I can't have some plan, because sometimes the source, the localization is not accessible to your telescopes, you need to go for the search of GW source candidate, equal-equal transient.

And this search goes, you need to observe it in 72 hours, with a delay of 72 hours from the first message associated to this gravitational alert. 

**(17:14 Transient source candidates)**
So this is some candidate. So that I call GW candidate, and this is very important.

This candidate, you won't have it on Slack. You will receive it by email, because the FA, so this is an action of the FA, it will transmit you which candidate you need to observe. So this is something that the FA will tell you, either in observation, either you will receive an email. And this is very important, because in fact, you will, during an offer, you will really observe this GW source candidate. 

**(17:52 summary)**
So again, there is not only one GW source candidate, which means that, for example, if I am SHAO, I will observe a candidate that is different from UBE, or different from OPD, you know, so everyone has different things to do. This is very important, because you need to get it.

So I think I have done with all this first overview. And see you for the next video, when I will show you all the plan to receive the galaxy-targeting pointing and tying. So just as a recap, as a recap, as a recap.

So let me find my paper. So as a telescope team, you will receive different pointings, either observing galaxies, either performing tying. You need to do it within 24 hours.

And this, if you cannot observe, you need to say it in the Slack, on the observation, in Skyportal. I will show you how to do that just in a minute. And after, you move.

So if you cannot observe this promptly, you wait for message from the FA or by email to observe some GW source candidate. When the FA says stop, you need to stop everything, etc., etc.

**(19:36 interact with FAs)**
So for the candidate, you can have a message here from the FA to observe a source.

When you receive a GW alert, you can say like, so you need to say, you cannot say, I can't observe, right? This is not good. You say OPD, so you remind the name of the telescope for OPD one meter, cannot observe for today, you know, something like this, you know, so that the FA can record. Or if you are a bit, I mean, which is make easier everyone, is to directly go to the gravitational alert.

So for example, this is a gravitational alert. I go to social and I make a comment like OPD 1.5 meter, cannot observe this source within the next 24 hours. You know, this is a comment that I make, add comment, or something different.

So me as a telescope team, I have also TAO, so I said this to her as observe source XXX, etc., etc., to help the FA to understand what is your, what are you doing, you know, or plan or TCF plan, TCF plan to observe, to observe tonight. Okay, so thank you everyone. I will post that and if you have questions, please let me know and I'll switch to the technique straight away.

Thank you.


## 7.6 Plans, Images, Photometry (telescope teams)

**(00:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone, so now I'm going to show you how to have access to the plan of your observation.

**(00:11 prequeries which observations)**
 So remember that in the last video we were talking about the different type of observations that you can make, either within the galaxy, in the field of view, or just tiling in the field of view. This observation should be done within 24 hours, and if you cannot observe during these 24 hours, you need to only observe the gravitational wave source candidates, or what we call the transients, that the FA and the shifter will guide you which candidates you need to observe.

And this within 72 hours, and in case of that the contemporary has been detected, you need to follow up as deep as you can the candidates, but we will have another prize. 

**(01:10 tasks of telescope teams)**
So let me now see the different steps that I would like to show you in this video. So we have notify, so we show in the last video how to get notified from Skyportal, and you need to tell the FA, the follow-up advocate, in observation that you will or will not, you receive or you did not receive the alert.

Of course if you're sleeping or it's not the time that you're going to perform observation, you can say, yeah, we're observing a delay, or you check the weather. So the first step is to get notified, but also to notify the people that you're going to observe or not within 24 hours. The second task that you need to do is observing, the most funny part maybe, either galaxy or tilings or candidates in the 24 hours, 72 hours, depending on where you are.

And then number three of your task is to submit as soon as they come the image. So remember that for the image we need the astrometry in it, not only just whole image without dark, black, etc. So this is very important, the image.

And then within the next two days, three days, the photometry results. So now I'm going to share my screen, I'm going to show in my screen where you can, so notify, we already saw it in the last video, so just observe. So the observation plan, so let me go to my... So now I am, so remember that we have this alert, 230511CP.

Normally you have been notified by, sorry, it's in GW. 

**(03:23 access observation plan slack)**
So normally you have been notified because you're registered in GW alert. This is the first message preliminary.
And in the last video, I show you that how to receive the alert via Skyportal or via Slack or via phone. And then after a while, you see, so as I said, in the next 10, 15 minutes, you have this plan coming. And you can click on link, on the link.

So I click on the link, like I can do like you. 

**(04:00 owncloud presentation)**
And you see, so the name of the event, 230511CP. So this is true.

You have the different folder that you know about. Image, you can see image, logbook, new event. So logbook, it is where you're going to upload the photometry.

And GWEMOPT, in fact, is a new folder. So I click here. 

**(04:25 gwemopt)**
You have here two folders.

So if alert just come, there is just one. This is preliminary. You see, it's arrived earlier than this one because it's the first message.

So if I click on preliminary, I have access to two folders. Galaxy targeting and tiling. So if I go back, for example, I am TCA.

So I received a plan from tiling. So I go to tiling. And then I have access to my plan here.

And so you can see, it's not only one point that I need to follow up. Here is five fields. So you have the name, so TCA.

Yeah, it's me because I need to have started with TCA. Rank ID, one, two, three, four, five. So usually the one is the one with the best chance to have the source candidate in it.

The gravitational wave counterpart in it. And then you have tile ID. So this is more technical.

It is for us. So don't take care of it. And then you have the coordinate when you point the telescope.

So this is the center of, you need to point the telescope within the center. So within the center of this tile. And then you have, so the probability.

To, so sorry, this is RA/DEC, sorry. So this is RA and DEC. And this is a probability that the source is within this field.

And here, this is the tile according to your telescopes, because this is only a plan for TCA, for which you can observe. So for example, it can be observed at 8 UTC, of course, because TCA can observe during when it is around this time in France. So like 10 p.m. And I can, so all this tile I can observing straight away.

Sometimes you can see that a tile, it's better to observe the tile at the beginning because here it gives you really the scheduling, in fact. So even if this tile is more important to observe, maybe it's not the first one that you can observe within your night. And so if I am another telescope, you see, so the ops time will be different because, of course, Thierry, which is in La Réunion, so in India, the Pacific, in the Indian Sea, I don't remember how to say it, or the ocean, can observe earlier.

So if you are regarding who you are, you need to pick up the plan and start observation within. So for example, me, I would like to observe TCA. 

**(07:55 notify FA in skyportal)**
So I go to observation.

And I said, I received the plan. And I will start observing with TCA. And it's good to say ID 1 and tile ID, for example.

Tile ID, so ID 1 and tile ID. Okay. So this, I can also, as we saw last time, to put it here and add comment.

Because it's better because we keep it. So it's better, it's good to do in both ways, but it's better to do it in I-Care if you just want to do it for one. So I am doing the observation.

And so imagine, sorry, so I am looking at the plan. It's good to say from preliminary. And it's good one to check which plan and maybe to put the coordinate of the source.

So let me go back. Sorry. Tiling.

TCA, so the first one, this one. Okay. Why? Because, so it comes to my second point.

**(09:38 update vs preliminary)**
Maybe, so for example, I am TCA. I cannot observe right now. It is only 1 p.m. in France.

So maybe later, there will be an updated plan, as I said. So an updated plan for which the coordinates won't be the same. And this is a problem because I'm sure that some of you will confuse.

And you need to be very vigilant. So that's why it's good to, yeah, to copy-paste. Maybe just simply restart TCA and you just copy-paste this line.

So that everyone understands and there is no confusion. Okay. Okay.

So if, for example, tonight I see that there is an update, then I took the observation from the update plan. I won't took the one from the preliminary. And how do you know if there is a new plan or not? So it is again, if I go back to #gwalerts.

Yeah. So for example, this was a message from the preliminary. You see, preliminary.

But after a while, up, there has been another message from the same candidate. 230511cp. You see that it is an update.

And you see that the plan has been computed again. So you need to be very careful. So the plan is different.

For example, here it was 5 field, 7.3% of observation of the total credible region. While in this file, it was only 1%. For here, I computed more test scores.

But anyway, you need to be very, very learned for which plan you need to take when you start observation. Because if you don't start observation immediately, you need to wait. As TCA, it's better to take the most updated plan, the update one.

In any case, you have some problem to understand which plan you need to use, just contact the FA in observation. So like, I am confused about the plan. Okay.

**(12:23 reporting images)**
So imagine now you have observe, and you have an image. I have prepared something for you. So I have an image, and I need to upload it.

So again, I go to image, stack, and then I upload in my image. So as you see, so this is my image from TCA. But this is a wrong name.

As you see, we have a real, I mean, we have a way to name fit image in GRANDMA. So my image should start. So maybe, okay.

**(13:33 naming images)**
My image should be in the way of the name of the GW alert. So GW alert. My name as observer, the name of the telescopes, the time I have observed.

So I have observed, we say at 20. In which filters, if it is stack, so yes, then the number of image per exposure time. And here, I added this number.

So it corresponds to the pointing of the source. So if you, normally it's, so this is, yeah. And this is DEC.

So for a question of format is, I ask you to put this between so that we have our stuff. So which means that this is a coordinate that you have, I mean, the coordinates you have observed because you have different coordinates, different pointing to observe. So if you just put, if you put just nothing, then I need to report for a report.

That's fine because I have observed this. So I put again in my name. Okay.

To be sure that we understood that this image is, okay. So maybe this will change, but for the moment, we will keep it like this. And so I need to rename my GRANDMA that fits in with this name.

So I go to image type. Okay. Okay.

So let's see the OwnCloud. I mean, in the web, you can see that. Yeah.

So it has a good name. Sarah is happy. Maybe there are two time bits.

So we'll do it properly. So this is the correct name. What else? So then the second thing you need to do.

**(16:19 photometry in owncloud)**
So yeah, remember that this, it needs to be with astrometry. And then I need to upload my CSV, my result. So you need to create this by here.

I just created to show you. So I need to say which time I observe. Okay.

So can I turn it now? So I will turn it here. Which time I observe. So it was 25, 11.

You need to make it more property, but here is just an example. TCA. Here I put the filter that I, so here is MGD.

So you need to convert it. Here I put the filter clean in from Skyportal, et cetera, et cetera. As we did last time.

And I have done, this is me that done analysis. But for GW, you need to add as well the coordinate of the source once again. Because you will have multiple photometry.

So the source was that I observe. This one, again, this is the image corresponding to this one. And I've done my photometry for that.

So I just go back. Okay. And I add the source here at the beginning.

So here I am happy. And you need to do that because you have, so let me read. In logbook.

So you need to create that because you don't have, so you see the source is there now. And you need to create this file as a telescope team. Sorry, I'm getting a bit tired.

Because this is your role and the follow-up advocate will help you. But anyway, this is your task to do. 

**(18:49 photometry in skyportal)**
There is also another way to register, for example, some observation.

Is to go by Skyportal via this formula. I think you're already trained. If you need help, I need to do another video.

So thank you everyone to have listened to me for this technical part. And bye-bye.


## 7.7 GW source candidates - Transients (follow-up advocate)

**(00:00 Introduction)**
 Hello everyone, so now I would like to give the training, so this is for the follow-up advocates, part 3, and we're going to talk about the source candidates.

**(00:15 Source GW candidate : what is it ?)**
So, the source candidates, counterpart candidates, is what I call the source candidates. It comes after when there is a gravitational wave alert.

 First, you have message preliminary that happens within minutes, so after a gravitational wave is detected, you have the message within minutes. Then, remember that GRANDMA will automatically provide an observation plan, either with tiling, either with galaxy targeting, that will happen from 10 to 40 minutes after the first message, and the team needs to observe this within 24 hours. After that, there is no need to observe.

But because of this search, there will be some candidates within the counterpart that will be found, either by GRANDMA, either by other team, and this is what we call GW source candidates, so either by other team, either by GRANDMA, and we ask the telescope team of GRANDMA to observe them within 72 hours. 

So this is two types of observation, or even three types, galaxy tilings within 24 hours, and then gravitational source candidates within 72 hours. So this step, what is this step? It's just to find if among these source candidates, there is the counterpart of the gravitational wave alert, and we just follow this one.

 But for that, we need to observe them to see how it will fade, to see if this source candidate is the gravitational wave counterpart, or finally, it's just something like that. Remember, we have done that already with FINK during the training. Remember, FINK paper, and etc, etc.

So, these source candidates, just to recap, if someone is lost. So we have the 90% credible region provided by LIGO VIRGO. Then we're going to pave it, or we're going to check some interesting galaxies, and then this first step leads to some source candidates that we will follow, which means that all the telescopes of GRANDMA cannot observe all these sources.

The number of sources can vary, like from 1, from 0, to 20, let's say, 20, 50. It depends from different teams, so it's not only GRANDMA, in the others. And sometimes during the follow-up, we see that it's not the gravitational wave counterpart.

**(03:15 Select the source candidate )**
 or other teams say, oh no, it's not the gravitational wave counterpart, and so we need to stop observation also in GRANDMA.
.
So, how do you know that it is interesting? Why GRANDMA will follow this gravitational wave counterpart? So I'm just here, okay? Gravitational wave counterpart. Okay, so why do we need that it is interesting? So, we will read the GCN, maybe in the message sent by other teams, they say, yeah, it's so nice, it's so interesting, maybe it's sure, there is high probability that this is the counterpart. So serious, go, go, go, go, go, GRANDMA.

Sometimes in the message provided by the other team, it is, yeah, maybe this is just, but we don't know, we don't know the color, yeah, this is okay, we just send one or two telescopes of GRANDMA. 

Also, if you would like to say, do I ask GRANDMA to follow up these source candidates or not, you need to tell how many sources we are already observing GRANDMA. If we have already five sources and this source is not very interesting, it's not worth to trigger GRANDMA.

And then, ask, if you are lost, ask your weekly coordinator, like always, that will tell you what to do.

**(04:29 Timeline)**
 So I just like put in this paper the timeline, just to be sure that you have understood. So imagine that, oh no, this is not this one, imagine that we are at this alert, so remember GW is not starting with GW, it's starting with S, this is the 3rd, June 26th, 23rd, so imagine that we are in that situation, there is a gravitational wave alert coming.

The first source, for example, receives a gravitational wave alert. So it receives it and it receives a plan, it decides to follow up or not. Then the follow up advocate number 2, so for example it is you, you won't just like choose wait, oh, I'm waiting another alert, remember? You will maybe send the plan of Galaxy tiling for telescope that were during daytime, during that time, but need to observe something.

So this is you that decide whether or not they will observe it, regarding how it goes, if the source is very interesting or not. Then we have FA number 3, so because they have been already starting observation down, I mean, since 12 hours, you know, because from the FA1 to FA3 there is 12 hours, maybe there is some candidate proposed by GRANDMA or external. To be honest, we are trying to provide candidate from GRANDMA, but usually we can't, so we just follow up candidate from the external community.
But this is a secret, okay? So remember that, so imagine that there is a team that say, yeah, I have a source candidate from GW. So this comes from FA3, but still from this alert. So you need to do something.
And then FA number 4, you receive, you also look at the GCN, so the report from other team. And he saw that there is another interesting alert, so he will deal with this source candidate. But FA3 can also maybe, FA4 can also look at this candidate number 1. So this is really a team, okay? You just need not to wait, and yeah, you need to contact people.
And maybe FA number 4 will see that finally soure candidate number 1 is not any more interesting to follow up, so he needs to stop things within GRANDMA.

**(06:52 Summary)**
 So now just as a recap recap, because I like to make recap for you. I just need my paper.
So now I will show in the computer how to do this different step. I mean, see what the other team are doing, or GRANDMA. Register the source from Skyportal.

Whether or not we're going to follow up with GRANDMA. How to stop observation in GRANDMA. And check the photometry.

**(07:21 GCN)**
Okay, so let's go now. So now, so first, remember in my just presentation, we go to nasa.gcn.gov. You have this page. So you need to first sign in.

I don't show how to sign in. Everyone knows how to sign in to a website. And for example, me, I go, you go then to profile, email notification, I think.

And I turn off, so it was off. I turn off and turn on circular. Okay, so this is the thing that you need to do.

So that you will receive by email all the message from NASA, GCN NASA. And in GCN NASA, you will receive this kind of image. 

**(08:09 GCN Circulars)**
You see, so maybe I go. Okay, I go. So the last message that was sent to all the list was Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor Trigger. Okay, nothing related with GW.

So last, last one, GRB. Okay, nothing related to GW. Another different alert. No, not GW. Ah, LIGO Virgo. Yeah, GW.
S230522N, Global Master Net Observation. So usually, we don't care about master. So we don't take care.

And then there is this one associated to this alert. So you see, master was associated to 0522N. And here, it is associated to 18H.

So for example, I am the shifter. I look at this GCN. So you see, blah, blah, blah, blah. So he said that SWIFT observation candidates began 73 hours. So you see, it's very old. But no matter what, we're going to try to say, imagine that it's very interesting.

We're going to try to record this target. No, it's not very interesting because we don't have the coordinates. So I will find another example nicer.

**(09:31 Add a source in skyportal)**
So this one. So we look at 21K. Okay. And he proposed two candidates. And these are the coordinates. Okay.

So I go to ICARE. And I go down. We see add source. Grandma. Yeah. Object.

So object is this one, we said. So I took that name. If there is two names, you just select your favorite one. Okay. So. Okay.

So then you tell me, right ascension, declination. So right ascension. Oh. Oh. Declination. 

Submit. I submit. So save. So usually I advise you to always reload a bit the page.
So we are happy because there is a new source. It's my source that I have added.

**(10:49 Add photometry from the GCN)**
If you would like, because we see the photometry. So the photometry is 15.56J. You can go to this page. No, sorry. To that page.

Because here we just create the coordinate. And we can upload photometry via the form. Here you will select Grandma.

Observation that the one that were said. So sometimes they don't say it. But yeah. Maybe this one. If it is, it needs to be in UTC. So you need to convert it. I don't do it now. What is important is to have the origin. Sorry.

The instrument you click on generic. Okay. Because generic is a GCN. Generic GCN. Okay. And then when the form is done, you click to submit.
So this is what you need to do. 

**(11:52 Comment and ask observations)**
And then to ask a telescope's team to observe. So it's like, hi, I have created this source.

And you can put here the subject. So that we know where it comes from, etc., etc. So once again. And the number. Okay. Ah.

And then this is ICARE, yeah. And if it's really interesting, you can wake up everyone by saying, Go Grandma, probability one. And then if I go back to dashboard, you see my source.
And go Grandma.

**(12:57 Stop observations)**
If, for example, you're on the next shifter and you show in the circular, someone saying, no, finally, it's not very interesting. Or it is like today that we have no feedback from no one.
You select Stop Grandma. And you go there. And you say.

Or you can say, or I can say. Toto, this is a name. Lily, can you confirm with TCA that, so it's a telescope that they will observe.

No? Or TCA told me that they have uploaded the image. You know, this kind of stuff.

**(14:34 Send an observation plan to one telescope)**
 If you want to send only an observation plan for someone, or someone from the team would like to send it to themselves, you can, for example, I select TAO.

Grandma, okay, PS1, super, perfect. I want to observe it today. And for tomorrow. And I click Submit. Okay. And when I go to, which one am I? You see, I have a plan submitted.

Usually there is this thing, so it's a bug, don't worry, but it is submitted. And so what does it mean? So this person, I mean, you select TAO, so TAO is me. 

So if I go back to my email, you see, because it was Go Grandma, I received a first email to say that it was Go Grandma.

And I received another personal message because you triggered me, you see. And also Salome and Alain. So this is the way to contact him.

**(15:46 Telescope teams contact)**
So people will ask me, yeah, but I don't know who is contacted. So you can go to Allocation. And this is all the telescopes in Grandma.

And if I go there, so Allocation, okay, Allocation. And you see who is registered. So the telescope team can modify this page.

Maybe it's not up to date, but this is something that we can see.

**(16:18 Associate to the GW event)**
 So something also interesting to do is, for example, this, remember, this event was associated to 18H. So we can go up and find out 18H.

So, for example, it's a bit old. So I go through GCN. So it's GWGRB Neutrino. And I put 013, 05. Do we have something? CDH, yeah, this is this one. No.

Looks strange, but anyway. And here, to the corresponding alert, you can write a message. I have added a source in Skyportal related to that event. For example.

**(17:41 Report GCN results in skyportal)**
 Okay, so this is good to always keep track on things. The question is, so I suggest from the GCN effect, which would be very, very good, is like, you just like start.

And as soon as there are GCN related to the event, you just copy-paste them and mention them in Skyportal. So, for example, if I took a, oh, so it was 21K. Okay, so we cannot do that.

Anyway, so just check that this is the correct event, because here, this is 21K. But I make a mistake, because this is not 21K, this is 18R. So I made a mistake, so I can delete my comment.
And I can go back to find 21K. Search. This is 21K.

So, we're there. And you can do that so that the next shifter can understand when a look that I have, I create some source for that. So, if, for example, the source was not interesting, but you add it, 

**(19:38 When you decide not to follow-up)**
you can make a statue like Notacare, you know, so that, you know, it will help GRANDMA to understand.

So, let me see if I have sent, yeah. So now, the telescopes team, imagine that they have observed something. So remember that in the last campaign, there was needed to add in the logbook the photometry.

**(20:03 Photometry from GRANDMA)**
So here, if they give you the, for example, this year, that the photometry is at ###. So, if they told you that, or if they do that in the logbook, you can, yourself, using the same formula as last time, and enter the corresponding instrument. Okay, so it's really better to do it via Skyportal.

Or, you can look, and I will ask the telescopes team to do that, at the logbook, when normally they have uploaded a file that looks like, that looks like, that looks like this. When you have the source, and maybe they can provide the name of the source, maybe. Here, name of the source.

They have provided in which filter they have observed, and the magnitude. So, if they provide that in a file, maybe it is easier. But any case, you, the FA, is responsible to add all the photometry that is within GCN.

Okay, because you need to do that. And maybe you can, at the end of your shift, saying that I have stopped looking at GCN up to, for example, So, for example, me is 97. 3-3-8-5-7.
3-3-8-5-7. 3-3-8-5-7. 3-3-8-5-7.

You know, so that the next shifter can understand that you are there. Okay, so this is the big stats of the FA. Of course, you cannot be just on your screen and just, like, say, yeah, I'm looking at my email, but you can, you know, look regularly, like, every, like, two or three times during your shift.

**(22:37 Bonus: send circular)**
Got it? The last one that I would like to show you is, like, with this NASAGov circular view, this is also the way that we will send the circular to everyone. So, there was some bug during Goal 3. This is for part number 4. It will be managed by your weekly coordinator, but at least we capture the candidate sequence. So, thank you for your time.
I will pause this video right now and take care of you. Bye.


## 7.8 GW alert: different types

**(0:00 Introduction)**
Today, I would like to talk about the gravitational wave alerts and in this video we are going to understand what it means gravitational wave alert. In this video, we are going to see how we can be notifies and what are the different types of gravitational wave alerts. 

**(0:23 Notify)**
To be notified in GRANDMA as FA, you need to be registered to #gwalerts channel on slack. In this channel, you will receive different types of alerts.

**(0:40 Preliminary)**
The first type of alert you will receive when an event is detected by LVK is a PRELIMINARY alert. This alert arrives when the objects has already collided and the system on LVK takes a few second to a few minutes to process. This is the PRELIMINARY alert that and it has a skymap associated with it. This way  we can point our telescopes. 

**(1:25 Early)**
LVK, in fact, before the PRELIMINARY has also delivered publicly an early warning alert. We do not follow up in GRANDMA because there is no skymap associated with it so its not worth it to listen. The early warning happened before the PRELIMINARY.

**(1:58 Preliminary)**
 In GRANDMA, we focus on the PRELIMINARY alert. If you are a shifter, you receive a PRELIMINARY warning on #gwalerts. 

**(2:15 Initial)**
The gravitational wave experts in LVK also receive the PRELIMINARY alert and they are woken up to understand whether or not it comes from an astrophysical event or not. After a while, they’re going to send an INITIAL alert. For the INITIAL, it happens in several dozens of minutes, to one hour, to several hours and sometimes INITIAL is not sent to the community or is never received by GRANDMA. It is important because in case it is finally not astrophysics you will receive a retraction from the INITIAL statues. 

**(3:11 Update)**
After hours or one day, we receive an UPDATE alert from the same event. From the same event: we have PRELIMINARY, INITIAL and UPDATE alerts. So, when you're a shifter, you can receive an UPDATE alert where the previous alerts occurred during a previous shift.


**(3:42 Deal with all the alerts)**
So, as a shifter, you need to treat all the alerts, whether you have received PRELIMINARY alerts during your shift or not. 

**(3:56 Skymaps)**
In the UPDATE, we use all the parameter space of gravitational waves to construct the skymap. This skymap and the localization error is different from the INITIAL and PRELIMINARY. In fact, in our grandma paper, we use the update skymap to produce our results. But, we usually follow up with the PRELIMINARY and the INITIAL. Usually, the PRELIMINARY and INITIAL has the same skymap. The INITIAL skymap is a confirmation of the PRELIMINARY skymap. Sometimes, the skymap is different and as a FA you may need to redirect some kind of viewpoints after the initial. Usually, the update arrives too late to change the plan because the plan is already finished and the UPDATE is only for the paper. 

**(05:06 Conclusions)**
You will be notified by the #gwalerts. You will receive PRELIMINARY which is extremely important, and the one that we wake up to. You can then face an INITIAL that will tell you if an event is astrophysical or not. Then, several hours later you will receive an UPDATE that provides the final skymap. 


## 7.9 Non-European weekly coordinators : How to create a shift in Skyportal

**(00:00 - 00:45)** I would like to create a video for a person that would like to be a weekly coordinator but is not working in Paris time or in Europe time. And I would like to show how to create a shift when you are not in Europe. So let me share my screen. 

**(00:45 - 1:16)**  Here first you need to connect to skyportal-icare.ijclab.in2p3.fr and you go to the screen and then you go down to the shift - Dashboard, Sources, Candidate and Shifts. I click here. For the moment what you see is, this kind of things, may you don’t have the same scale here because you are not working in Paris time zone. You have something different. 

**(1:16 - 1:33)** And if I go next, next, next, I see some slots that are already filled, because in fact me Sarah, I have already filled the slots and I see only the ones that I am associated with. For example, my filled slots, nice. 

**(1:33 - 1:53)** If I would like to see all the shifts, then I click on show all the shifts up, show all shifts. And then I see all the shifts from my other colleagues. So for example, this one is with admin Martin Blazek. Whereas this one is me.

**(1:53 - 2:16)** Here the idea today is to know how to create a shift on a week when you are not in France or in Europe. The shift does not start from Monday to Sunday. It starts from Thursday to the next Thursday,

**(2:16 - 2:55)** thats why for this slot, thats called Kenza team start on Thursday night in Paris and ends on Thursday afternoon. So it always start at 6 pm French time. So 4 pm UTC time. So now I will show how to create this slot when you are not in Paris but when you are in USA or in Asia. 

**(2:55 - 3:42)** So for example, if I like to be a weekly coordinator and I want to create the shift from Thursday 3rd to Thursday 10th. So I am not in Paris, so I don’t see the same Paris time. I clicked on add new shift on top right and choose group “GRANDMA”, shift name party, number of users 2, description nothing, divide it by day - very important, and then here it is not local time, it is UTC time. Then we are 8, 8 in 8. It starts in August and finished in August. 

**(3:42 - 4:36)** It starts on Thursday 3rd, and finished on Wednesday 9 for the moment. So the first slot in UTC will start at 4 pm and will finish at 10. I just do that because we don’t want overlap. So 4 to this, divide it by day, 2 slots, Party, GRANDMA. Everything is fine. 

**(4:36 - 5:07)** So I click submit. And then I have slots here and arriving here. So you see in my view in Paris time, it perfectly fit the other shifter’s slot. So then I will create this slots. But for the next slots, I decided that I will be available as weekly coordinator to also to question to beginner shifter/Followup Advocate. 


## 7.10 European weekly coordinator How to create a shift in Skyportal

**(0:00 - 0:18)**
Hello everyone, I hope that you're fine. So I'm gonna show you how to set up some shift as weekly coordinator. So weekly coordinator, this video is for weekly coordinators, not for shift weekly coordinator.

**(0:19 - 0:47)**
So let me share my screen. Yeah, one second, I'm sharing the screen. So this is Skyportal, so you need to log on Skyportal, iCare, edclab.ein2p3.fr. And here on the dashboards, there is dashboard, GW, GRB, Neutrino, sources, candidate, favorite, and shift.

**(0:47 - 1:16)**
You click on shift. So normally it is like this, and to show some shift from everyone to see then the slot is visible, you click show all shift. So now we're gonna create, find a slot on shift from May 7, 13 to, so this period is up to August 27.

**(1:18 - 1:53)**
So I will put a slot, let me delete this. So to delete, for example, some slot because I was mistaken, you can do like this, okay. So I would like to, sorry, I would like to create some new shifts in that period because I would like to be a weekly coordinator from 6th of July, Thursday to 13th of July, Thursday.

**(1:55 - 2:06)**
So for that, I will create a new shift. So add new shift. I will find the group GRANDMA and then the shift name, whatever you like.

**(2:06 - 2:18)**
So piupiu, number of user required for the shift. So for this shift at play time, there will be only one shifter and me coordinator. So one plus one, so two.

**(2:19 - 2:26)**
So I put two, three plus question, we don't care. Divide per day, very important to put it. And local time.

**(2:26 - 2:48)**
And here, maybe you don't see the same screen as me because here it is with French time. But obviously, if you go with UTC, it will be with another, in another, it will be another display. So now I use, so I need to put like July 6 with some.

**(2:49 - 3:29)**
So this is the slot of eight, this and this, this. And seven, so seven up to, let's say Thursday, 13th. Thursday, 13th.

**(3:29 - 3:48)**
So Thursday, 13th, no, Thursday, 12th, sorry. Because it's starting on six, but finishing the slot on 12. So 12, and then I need to put 23, 59.

**(3:49 - 3:58)**
59, it's very important not to have overlap. Seven, 12, so I think it's fine. And I'm gonna add it.

**(3:59 - 4:15)**
So now I have my slots. Then I would like to be, so I will be shifter now. So me and another person will be shifter from 12 to six.

**(4:16 - 4:27)**
So I will add, and this is the slot. So if I am with the coordinator and on shift, I will add someone else. I will add something in the description.

**(4:27 - 4:49)**
So I show you, so GRANDMA, shift name, again, piupiu. Then the number of user is the same, but here it's slots only for beginner. Slots only for beginner, yeah.

**(4:49 - 5:17)**
Divided by day, local time. And then I put seven, seven. So this now will not start on six, it will start on seven because it is, we start the shift during 6 p.m. So then the first date for this weekly slot is on seven.

**(5:19 - 5:43)**
So seven, seven, seven, no, not seven, sorry. Seven, so we will up to 13, you see, 13, okay. So here it is, 17, 59, yes.

**(5:45 - 6:02)**
And, and, and, and, 12, 12, okay. So this is my local time, divided by day. Slots only for beginner, GRANDMA, piupiu, and then isolated.

**(6:03 - 6:12)**
So here we go, there is these things up to Thursday. So we are good. Okay, good luck with yours.

**(6:12 - 6:32)**
And the last point is that you do not only have one slot regarding the LOI. If you ask either to be weekly coordinator every month, you need to put like four if it is every eight weeks. So just manage, it's not only putting one slot, it's about like what you have written in your LOI.

**(6:33 - 6:35)**
Thank you everyone, and bye-bye.


## 7.11 Managing the ZTF candidates (follow-up advocate training)

**(0:02 - 0:15)**
So hello, Grandma. So after a presentation I made on the Grandma Telecon of Thursday, I was asked to make a video about the ZTF candidates management. So here it is.

**(0:16 - 0:31)**
So the topic of this video is to explain or give some information about how to deal with ZTF counterpart candidate. And basically, we have two ways of receiving these alerts. So the first is via ZTF Team GCNs.

**(0:31 - 1:02)**
In that case, we as shifters or follow-up advocate, we have to add the candidates and the photometry on Skyportal. The second way to receive those alerts is via the theme broker on Skyportal main page. And in that case, a follow-up advocate, we have to update the tag from iCare or to not iCare or ask for follow-up if you think that the candidate is interesting and want follow-up.

**(1:03 - 1:29)**
The question is how to deal with these candidates and how to make the decision to trigger their network to perform follow-up observations. And the basic things to do is, in my opinion, to go on the fink web portal that you can access via this URL and type the ID of the alert. So that should look like ZTF23 and a bunch of letters that correspond to the unique ID of the transient.

**(1:30 - 2:01)**
It may appear that the alert is not available in Fink. For example, if the candidate has been added manually on Skyportal and it has not automatically been filtered by the classifier of Think. In that case, another way to have information on these candidates is to go on another ZTF broker, such as ALeRCE or Lasair, with those two web URLs.

**(2:05 - 2:34)**
The question is, as a follow-up advocate, to make a decision about whether or not the transient should be followed. It's particularly difficult when we have only one or two points of photometry. Which is the situation we most likely will have to face during a shift because the transient will be detected just after a gravitational wave transient.

**(2:34 - 2:56)**
And then we will have a very few points. So I'd like to propose some criterions to veto ZTF candidates proposed by Fink. So maybe the first natural thing to do is to cross-match the position of these alerts with the most recent gravitational wave alerts.

**(2:56 - 3:36)**
If none of the two, three previous gravitational wave alerts don't have the localization that includes some of these ZTF alerts, well, the alert is not worth following up. It's not a good candidate for being an electromagnetic counterpart. If it appears that a ZTF alert is coincident in space with a gravitational wave, then another thing to do is to go on the Fink web portal and check the classification.

**(3:36 - 4:04)**
If the candidate has been classified as something that's not a kilonova, such as a solar system object or supernovae, well, it's probably unrelated to the gravitational wave alerts and doesn't require any more follow-up. You may face the case where Fink classification is inconclusive. For example, if it's mixed between three or four different categories, or if it's classified as unknown by Think.

**(4:04 - 4:39):**
In that case, the alerts broker might help you for making a decision. Although we have to also keep in mind that grammar collaboration is closely related to the Fink collaboration, and that's not the case for the alerts one. If we have questions regarding the classification or the way the alerts are filtered by the alerts, it will be much more difficult to have information.

**(4:39 - 5:13)**
We should primarily refocus and keep our decision based on Fink information. Another good criterion to veto or not some ZTF candidates is to check when was the last detection. Beyond three to five days, that's probably not interesting anymore, in particular, if we're looking for kilonovae, because those kind of transient are expected to decay extremely rapidly with a rate of 0.3 to 0.5 magnitude per day, based on 170817.

**(5:14 - 5:48)**
After three to five days, especially considering the distance at which gravitational waves are detected, we won't be able to observe these transient with most of the grammar instruments. If no one else reported that it was a credible kilonovae candidate, it's probably not interesting anymore. A last criterion that could be easy to check is to look at the luminosity decay rate.

**(5:48 - 6:13)**
If it's below 0.3 magnitude per day, it's probably not a kilonovae. This decay rate is based on the gravitational wave detected in August 2017. Although this is not a hard limit, so it can be a bit above or a bit below these thresholds.

**(6:14 - 6:30)**
And we should be open-minded, because we don't have a lot of information about kilonovae diversity. And after all those criterions, I would like also to warn about what I just said. So these are basic rule of thumbs.

**(6:31 - 7:08)**
None of those criteria should be a hard stop, especially when we are looking at BNS gravitational wave candidates, because in that case, we expect electromagnetic emission. And we should be extra careful and look actually at the GCN from other collaborations. However, these returns should be easy to deal with most binary black hole merger cases, as we do not expect much electromagnetic counterpart in those events.

**(7:09 - 8:58)**
Although we should also not hesitate too much to ask for GRANDMA members help when some candidates are ambiguous, because we would be very sorry to miss some kilonovae, because we were not completely sure about what we were dealing with. Now that I have some of these representations, I'd like to give some examples that I actually had to deal with during my follow-up advocacy shift a few days ago. So like I said, on the Skyportal on I-care, you have here the gravitational alerts that are displayed.

And here on this panel, you have the ZTF kilonovae candidates provided by Fink. And I'd like to give two examples that actually happened during my shift. So these alerts, so ZTF23AANPZMV and ZTF23AANFWYW.

So those two alerts were recorded on Skyportal here for PZMV and WYW here. So they were classified as kilonovae candidates. So the first thing we have done is to go on the Skyportal web portal.

So this is the main page of the broker. And I typed here the ZTF ID, so these names here that are displayed on my tabs. After that, it get me to the Fink web portal page link related to these alerts.

**(8:59 - 9:44)**
So at the time of my shift for this alert, so WYW, I only had those points. And it was five days after the detection that we had to make the decision on whether or not to continue the follow-up. So based on that, my thoughts were that it was detected five days ago, so quite an old alert with only one detection.

If it was a kilonovae, GRANDMA would not be able to do much, especially with most instruments. And in addition, at that time, the Fink classification was not in favor of a kilonovae. It was more classified as unknown or either supernovae.

**(9:45 - 10:07)**
So based on those information, I decided to just go for a not ICARE. The second alert I had was sort of PZMV. And in that case, there were no information on Skype portal, on the Fink Skype portal, because it was this transient was added manually.

**(10:07 - 10:44)**
So it has no webpage because it has been classified with Fink. But at that time, I had to go on the ALERS ZTF Explorer broker and check for the classification provided by ALERS. And the classification was it was an asteroid.

So I decided, based on this information, to just not ICARE. I decided to type not ICARE on Skype portal. And yeah.

**(10:46 - 11:22)**
I also had a look on the other transient on ALeRCE, and it appeared that it was classified as a bogus in ALeRCE. And so it confirmed my classification of not ICARE for those two alerts. So I think it will be all for that video.

I'd like to thank you for listening, and I wish you were a good shift and a good O4 run.
