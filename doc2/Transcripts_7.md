## 7.1 What is the role of a follow-up advocate (shifter) in GRANDMA during the next GW observing run (O4)?

**(0:00 Global picture)**
Hello everyone, I would like to give a bit of explanation about what is a follow-up advocate within GRANDMA, a follow-up advocate or a shifter. So in fact, this is a big role in GRANDMA because it helps to notify the telescopes team when there is a gravitational alert, and to help them for pointing the telescopes at the correct location over the sky. So as a follow-up advocate or shifter, you need to guarantee that the alert has been well received and that they are performing good observations for the best scientific return of gravitational astronomy.

**(0:42 Organization)**
So to achieve this, in GRANDMA we have established like 24 hours and seven days schedule, that in fact is divided into four slots. So as a follow-up advocate, you operate during the week from Thursday to Thursday, during six hours, and then there is someone else that operates six hours, on six hours, and six hours. So you have also a weekly coordinator that helps to guide you, it's like kind of a mentor.

**(01:18 Task 1 GW alert)**
So the first task is a different task, and the first task is the gravitational wave alert, which means that you need to better determine whether or not it is a high profile alert or not. Because you will perform different actions if it is extremely important, or if it is just like routine gravitational wave alerts and we expect not so good scientific return compared to high profile.

 So how to determine that the gravitational wave alert is high profile? So number one, you need first to understand if the source is probably astrophysical or not, because sometimes the detector sends you some alerts, but in fact it has nothing to do with the sky, it's just not.

So you need to make sure that it is astrophysical. Second point is to make sure, I want you to check if it is a coalescence of a binary of two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole, because this is where we expect light coming, and so optical signature. Number three, you need also to check whether or not the event is close or far away.

If it is close, below 200 megaparsec, then it is high profile. Number four is to check in fact the size of the sky localization area. If it is below 200 degrees squared, then it means that it is also high profile.

So to ponder this, we can also see if it has been detected by one interferometer, two or three interferometers. So we will provide you some kind of score, automatic, from one to three. Three is like very extremely interesting, and one is, yeah, it is a gravitational alert, but it is you that is in charge to understand whether or not it is high profile or not.

So how are you going to receive this alert? Via Slack, via Skype or maybe by your phone, it is up to you. And this platform, Skyportal is hosted at ijclab.

**(03:52 Task 2 Notify)**
So now, task number two is to notify the telescope team. So what does it mean to notify the telescope team? Because in fact, the telescope team has already received the alert automatically and they are pointing to guarantee that they have received it and they are starting to observe if it is nighttime right now.

So after evaluating how it is interesting, you need to correspond with the telescope team. So the telescope team and you are going to exchange in the GRANDMA slack channel #observation. 

And in fact, you can delay your communication to a team that, for example, it is daytime, for example, in France, because there is no need to start prompt observation on the alert. But for teams, so if it is daytime in France, which means that it can be nighttime in China or in Australia, and then you need to make sure that they have started observation because we want best observation as fast as possible. 

You also need to take into account the observability condition for telescopes, which means that sometimes it is night, but they cannot observe the source because it is too low compared to the horizon or it is the best sources are only visible at daytime or it is not, its raining or things like this.

 So in fact, you need to reconcile when you contact the telescope team, how many points they can observe, how many observations they can make regarding the properties of the gravitational alert, and how it is urgent to perform observation. 

And when you have evaluated situation you can email the team just like, and you can even call them, welcome them to everything so that's, I mean, if it is urgent, you need to be there. That's why there is a swift 24 hours to make sure that the one that you need in short observation is starting to observe.

And it is essential to report in Skyportal everything in the lab book on Skyportal because then we need to have some feedback about the story and so on and so forth. And you also need to report to the next colleagues that will contact other teams when it will be nighttime. So, sometimes you will receive also, in the meantime that you're operating this task too, a message from the LVK that finally is not astrophysical so you need to send to all team yes stop observation because it's not astrophysical, and so you can do it here on Skyportal.

 So, the rules for contacting a telescope team is to contact them just before tonight so around 6pm at their local time. So sometimes you don't, you just don't need just to wait like this, there is a gravitational alert, you need to, you need maybe to do something from the previous alert that the other shift has done. So this is really a teamwork.

**(07:29 Task 3 Images)**
So text, three. Where is my paper, yeah. Text three is about image, which means that your task consists on once telescopes team are starting to observe to make sure that they have uploaded the image in our OwnCloud or in our Skyportal. And that's the image have the correct name, and the correct format. 

So why because then we will, I mean we will, we can rerun the analysis to understand like the brightness of the source etc etc so it needs to be in the good format, and it needs to be there. So the telescopes team have 24 hours from their observation to upload the image in our Skyportal. 

So, you need also to guarantee that they have also give you the photometric results, not only the image, the photometric results. For this, it's a science, you don't need to ask them on photometry or manual performance, but otherwise, they need to upload the photometric results. So, for this part is a bit tough so you can ask or can ask for assistance from to the weekly coordinator.

**(08:56 Task 4 Transient)**
So now, task number four is about transience, this means the toughest task as a follow up advocate, because what you need to know is that it's not only about like oh there is a gravitational wave and yeah we start observation, we have image making we detect new sources that can be the gravitational wave counterpart, and the job is done. 

No, because once the first step has been done, which is scanning, scanning the localization error box, then we need to find candidates. And this candidate can be either the gravitational wave counterpart, or the other things like supernova, or planet, or star birth, etc etc.

So, we need to define which one is the gravitational wave counterpart, and which are the other contaminants. And to do that, we need to point again the telescopes on this target. And what is your task, your task is to ask people to look at all the different sources, and to ask targeted observation to the team. 

In parallel, you're looking at what the other people are doing outside of GRANDMA, because they also come from gravitational wave follow up, and they will also detect transients. And so maybe you will find some of the GRANDMA telescopes to the transients from external team. So to do that, you will use some external tool like GCN, like you will scan the report by other team.
And you will also make, I mean, point the telescopes to the GRANDMA one. So really, your task is to guide the astronomer to point the telescopes at the right location for that transients.

**(11:05 Final Report)**
 So your final task is to produce a report, a report to the community, the GCN, but also a report to GRANDMA to see what's happened, etc etc.

 In this report, we need to show which observation has been made, do we detect transients, something that can be the kilonova or GRB associated to the gravitational alert, or if we did not detect anything, what is the sensitivity of our observation. 

We need also to report there the photometry from the transients sources, the candidate, whether or not it is spreading, whether or not it is not. This report will be done with the three other shifters and with the help of the weekly coordinator. 

**(11:59 Recap)**
So let me remind that task one is gravitational alert. Wonder if it is urgent to trigger telescopes or not. Number two, notify observers, either for rapidly scanning the localization, either to point the telescopes at interesting sources. Number three is to make sure that all the images are in upload and in Skyportal, to enable the scientific exploitation from this campaign. Number four is to filter the candidates to select the one that can be the gravitational wave counterpart. And final task is the report.

So thank you. If you have questions, of course, you can email me as always.


## 7.2 How to register as a GRANDMA followup-advocate (shifter) ?

**(0:00 Introduction)**
Today I would like to show you how to sign on on shift. A shift is happening from Thursday to Thursday during six hours. So you can be shifter or follow-up advocate.

Shifter equal to follow-up advocate and follow-up advocate equal to shifter. So six hours on Thursday, six hours on Friday, six hours on Saturday, six hours on Sunday, six hours on Monday, six hours on Tuesday, and six hours on Wednesday. So in this video, I will show you how to sign on as to be a follow-up advocate.

This needs to be fitting what you have signed on in the LOI that your group leader has signed on for you. So let's share my screen and we're going to do that in Skyportal. 

**(1:02 Connection to Skyportal-Icare)**
So first you need to connect to skyportal.icare.egclab.en2p3.fr. So here you see ICARE, so Skyportal equal to ICARE, ICARE equal to Skyportal.

So when I refer to Skyportal, I refer to ICARE and when I refer to ICARE, I refer to Skyportal. ICARE is just a version developed for GRANDMA on the Skyportal system. So here I see the platform and I go to shifts.

**(1:38 Visualize Shift Page)**

So for the moment, I see that there is nothing in my agenda and this is completely normal. You can see the time, maybe if you're not in in France, you see or in Europe, you don't see the same time here. This is based on the local time.

So first you can see, you will click on show all shift and O4 is starting is starting on 24th of May. So we have shift before that is reserved for our weekly coordinator and then we will have shift, we will ask you to start register you as a (NIYATI) slots up to up to up to this one, Bella Papaya.

**(2:40 Register (join,leave))**
So how to sign on for a shift? So I choose for example, the NIYATI slot.

So for example, in France, I would like to perform my shift from 6pm to 12pm. So I will use register this one, this one, this one. And then next week, this one, this one, this one, this one.

So if I, if I sorry, if I would like prefer the slot from 12 to 6, then it will start on Friday because in fact, the shift starts at Thursday night. So how, so me, I decided that I would like to do an early shift in France. So starting at 6am to 12.

So I will go to NIYATI and I will click on join. And you see, my name is appearing. I don't know why as admin, but normally it's appearing as members.

So for example, finally, I'm too busy and it's not the week that I wanted, I will leave. And for example, I will choose to be with the Omega team, but still at 6 to 12. So I join, yeah, join.

And then my name appear as member admin. It doesn't matter if it is an admin or members. It's just because, it's just because sometimes the weekly coordinator did not create a shift.

So you need to be at admin, but it doesn't matter for the rest. You just need to be sure that your name appear here. So for example, I would like to start with Omega team run by Martin.

So I registered this and then I need to register all day, right? So the same time. So I cannot do that and then do that. No, only at the same time during all the week.

So tag, then join, then join, join. So if I am mistaken, I can click on here, join, join. 

**(5:14 Beginner option)**
So if I would like to say that I am beginner, I just have like, I'm beginner, right? It's better to add a comment.

For some of the slots, for example, some of the slots, for example, this one, it is specifically said that it's open for beginners. So you can register to this one because you don't feel capable to run your own shift. 

**(5:47 One shifter per slot)**
So compared to the last campaign here, there is only one member per slot.

You are not only, you are not two shifter per slot. You're only one, but you have friends from other slots and also your weekly coordinators that can help you. So yeah, it's going to be okay.

If you want to understand better about what is your role, I have done another video that you can look on YouTube. 

**(6:14 References)**
For the practice, you will be practice with your weekly coordinator. So here it is Kenza compared to here.

It is Martin. He will explain to you all of this later. We are still working on the techniques.

So which tool you're going to use as a follow-up advocate. So please be patient. You can, so if on your LOI, it has been said that you will be on more than one shift per three months, you need to register two times.

It's not necessary to only select, for example, for me is a six. So for example, I can choose another time. So for example, with Oleksandra and I will choose this time to register at night.

It is really depending on your calendar. Just be sure that when you have signed on, you're pretty clear about like that you really want this slot because otherwise it's a mess to organize. And we are very few people to organize GRANDMA.

So we really, really, with Iara, count on you to really do this task before 12th of May. Okay. So thank you so much and see you soon.


## 7.3 Preliminary alert slack message

**(0:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone So this is the training for understanding what is the preliminary alert and we are going to see directly, we are going to go directly into GW alerts to understand what is going to return in slack and how urgent it is so let me share my screen. 

**(0:30 waiting alert)**
So as you see I am on GW alert channel and so here (#gwalerts) and I am the shifter tonight.  You see I have content behind me and I am waiting for an alert. so let's see what is going on.

**(0:51 new preliminary)**
So oh a new alert comes. I know it because it is bold in #gwalert and a new message arrived in the channel. So let's read together

**(01:05 GW name)**
GW Candidate, why candidate? because we never know if it is actually a true astrophysical event or not. Then, we have 230511CP which is the name of the gravitational wave candidates or the sources. The sources start by S, so it doesnt start with GW, it starts with GW only when confirmed. But, when it is a candidate, it starts by S…like SUPER! We got to observe! It's like super. Then, 230511CP, so this event happened on 11th of May 2023. This is a test event thats why the event is a bit older and then 

**(01:52 preliminary tag)**
I promise you it is a preliminary alert. So this is the first message that you receive from S230511CP. And number 1 because a preliminary alert type can be sent multiple times. The first time that the preliminary alert has been sent to you and to GRANDMA. So now it's time to make decisions.

**(02:20 detectors)**
 Then, you have detected by H1,N1,V1. Which means that this alert, the gravitational wave, has been detected by the three interferometers. H1 Huntford, N1 for Livingston and V1 for 
VIRGO. We are so lucky. Three interferometer means localizations would be very precise and it is an event that we need to pay attention. If it was like just H1, it is a one single interferometer detection so it is not so interesting.
  
**(03:00 trigger time)**
So then let's see about this section: time. There is a trigger time which means it's T0, when the two compact objects collided happened on 20230511 at 17:22 UT. Its always in UTC not in your local time. Here, you have the history of the event so we have 3 days three hours 55 minutes. This is very strange because it happened 3 days ago. 

The thing that you need to check first, if this event happened after the time you are in, otherwise it is a test event, it is something weird. When time since T0 for preliminary is above one day, which means that we don't care about it. So you need to check if here it is less than a day.

Again, this is an example, this is a test event, so it's not a good example. Anyway, so then we go to properties. 

**(04:26 properties)**
And the first thing that you need to check is the preferred category.

So BNS is for value neutral star, and it is a very interesting event. It is our best event. So here we need really to wake up GRANDMA and do our best to follow up.

Then you have a score. So the score is two, you have score zero.

**(04:52 score)**
so not good event, not very interesting. One, no, two, oh yeah, why not? And three is golden, okay.

So why it is score two? Because it is a BNS, so it is score two. And then you have has NS and has remnant, which means that has NS equal to one, so which means that there is a possibility that there is a neutral star. So it is, sorry, it is, maybe there will be some matter around and some brightness.

And has remnant equal to one would mean that we expect some matter and some light surrounding the event. So we need to follow up. However, the thing that you need to really check is preferred category BNS and GRANDMA score equal to two or above, two or three.

**(05:56 skymaps)**
Then you have the sky map area. So 90% credible region. This is something very important because when it is below 200 degrees square, so here it is 671, it is very important.

So here in this event is not so important because the 90% credible region is 670, so it's quite large to observe. However, the 50% area is below 200 degrees square. That's why GRANDMA’s score is still two and not one, but it cannot be three because the 90% area is not below 200 degrees square.

**(06:45 distance)**
Then we have the distance of the event. How far is the event? And the distance is about like 248 megaparsec. So when it is below 200 megaparsec, the grandma score becomes three, very important because the distance, the event is quite close.

So there is special below 200 megaparsec and above 200 megaparsec. 

**(07:16 noise)**
And then you have this indicator which tells you how glitchy the event is. So coherence between detector versus noise.

If it is above zero, above three, which means that there is low chance that the event, there is high chance that the event is astrophysical. And when it is below minus three, it means that there is high chance that the event is not astrophysical. 

**(07:51 links)**
And here you have, in measurement, you have access to the LIGO Virgo page, public page, and here access to our Skyportal page.

**(08:03 message for FA)**

I need to delete that. And then I provide you a kind of summary. So it is very interesting that, however, not when localized, yeah, it is above 200 megaparsec. 

And for our IS, it is above 200, sorry, it is above 200 degrees square and is above 200 megaparsec. So GRANDMA is going to compute the plan for the different telescopes. (8:33) And if the area, the 90% area is still, if we don't reach 50% of the area, which means that  it's not for us to follow up and the plan won't be sent to the telescopes.

So let me summarize.

**(08:56 conclusion)**
 I will stop the sharing. Let me summarize how it is urgent to follow up. So you need to check whether or not it is a BNS or NSBH category.

You need to check if the distance is below 200  megaparsec and if the area is below 200 degrees square. Okay. If it does not fill this criteria, then the score will be less than three, two, one, zero.
If it is this criteria, then the score will be equal to three. And you need to try to wake up all of GRANDMA. If the score is two, then the plan will be computed and you will have access to upload. And this will be my next video. Thank you.


## 7.4 Notify telescope teams and Observation plan

**(00:00 intro)**
Hello everyone, so today we're going to talk about step 2, so notify. Last time we talked about the GW alert, one we're going to observe in GRANDMA, which type of alert, and today we're going to show how to notify the telescopes and how to produce the plan. So first I would like to come back about the gravitational wave area.

**(00:29 GW skymap: 90 c.r)**
So here you have, for example, the sky, and LIGO-VIRGO gives a 90% credible area here in black. A 90% credible area or 90% credible region of the sky map is the fact that in this area over the sky, there is 90% of chance that the source is located within this region, and there is 10% of the chance that the source is finally not in this region. So 90% area means that there is a control that defines the 90% of chance that the source is within this area.
50% credible region for the sky map, it means that there is 50% of the chance that the source is within this area, and 50% outside. So the sky map is just like the area of the sky, delimited by a certain confidence number. So remember after last time, after last courses, so we said that we can observe with GRANDMA BNS and NSBH events, when the event is located below 200 MPS, and for an area of the 90% credible region within 200°², so which means that this area, 90% credible region, is less than 200°².
So imagine that this region is several dozen of degrees squared, 100 or 200°², so you cannot point with one telescope something. 

**(00:29 GW skymap: 90 c.r)**
So that's why we will pave the sky, so this is again in black my 90% credible area in control, and we're going to pave the sky, so we have a wide field of view, this is a field of view from a telescope, this is a field of view from another telescope, all the telescopes, they don't have the same field of view, and we're going to pave the sky with all our telescopes in GRANDMA So for example, let's see TCR, which is from the TARO collaboration, it will look at this region of the sky, so we just take a picture from this region here, and then another picture here, which means that for a gravitational alert, we don't give only one pointing, but several pointing, for example, several pointing for this one and this one.
And for FRAM, so another telescope within GRANDMA, it will observe that region, that region, that region, so that we will cover all the sky map. So for the wide field of view, we're able to rapidly pave the sky map, the 90% credible region, but when you have a smaller field of view, you cannot pave because it's going to take a lot of time. That's why we give some interesting galaxies to observe, so here in red, I'm putting red in my picture, for example, giving pointing to SHAO, and this is what we call galaxy targeting compared to tiling.And so then we will fix on region, on galaxies that are located at a distance given by the gravitational wave alert. 
(04:08 Observation plan)
So here, when we talk about giving the observation plan to the telescope's team, it's, for example, galaxy at a certain distance, sorry, and different pointing, which means that if me, I am in SHAO team, and my friend in FRAM and I won't receive, sorry, the same plan with SHAO and with LEMAC. So which means as a follow-up advocate, you need to be very long, but because it's not like GRB or Kilonova, SHAO team, this telescope will receive different targets, so not only one, one, two, three, and LEMAC will receive another type of target.
So when someone said to you, give me the list, you need to provide the corresponding list according to the telescopes, okay? 

**(05:06 Tiling and galaxy targeting)**
So now I would like to give a bit some lessons. So I think you got it. So we have one strategy, which is tiling, and the other one, which is, sorry, galaxy targeting.
Maybe it's like this, because the camera is not standing. Okay, so tiling and galaxy targeting. So once more, oops, tiling and galaxy targeting.
This is not the same strategy. 

**(05:41 Tiling)**
So for the tiling, we have a few telescopes in GRANDMA, quite a number. So we have the TARO collaboration with TCH, TRO, and TCA. They come from TARO. One good news is that when the gravitational wave comes, and we are in the criteria that we saw last time, the plan is sent automatically. So as a follow-up advocate, you just need to check if in Sky Portal, TARO is observing or there is something wrong. We have another group that is called FRAM. So I will write it so that you get, you remember. So FRAM got two telescopes. Again, they are going to observe automatically, so you don't need to do anything unless there is something wrong. For example, you don't see any tiling, any tides, any pointing in Sky Portal, so you can come back, Sergey. For this TARO, you can contact Alain, Alain Klotz, or me, so the PI or the co-PI.
And then we have also access to other facilities. I won't talk about ZTF for the moment. Let's talk to OAG or CFHT. They are wide fields. They can do tiling, but we have only very few time. That's why if there is very interesting alert, discuss with the weekly coordinator.
Maybe we will activate observation with OAG or observation with CFHT. CFHT is me, OIG is Antonio. So if your weekly coordinator thinks that it's very important to observe, then we will compute.
In fact, the plan is already computed, but we will send this back to OAG and CFHT telescopes. So I hope that you listen to me, because this is the tiling, tiling telescopes.

**(07:46 Galaxy Targeting)**
 Now, about the galaxy targeting. So there are many telescopes in GRANDMA that can do galaxy targeting. The narrow field of view, so below 1° square, that they will observe if the gravitational wave is below 200° square. And so the list is a lot of telescopes.
So the list is a lot of telescopes as LEMAC. And here, your job as follow-up advocate is really to make sure that the team, they have understood to point, because it's not automatic. They won't perform, most of them, they won't receive the alert and the telescope will point automatically.
You need to make sure that they have received their list of targets, because remember, it's not one unique list of targets, it's several lists of targets. So you need to make sure that, for example, that you need to observe pointing 1 and 3, and, for example, LEMAC pointing 2 and 4. So this is your job. 

**(08:50 Notify)**
So that's why we come back to your job, which is notify. And for the tiling, it's mostly to check if TARO and FRAM are starting the follow-up, or in case of interesting, notify Antonio and I to make some dedicated follow-up. For the galaxy targeting, here is more, you need to engage more, because you need to notify the team, make sure that they have understood that they will be, they have well received their plan. And now, in the second part of this video, we're going to see in Skyportal and in Slack and in OwnCloud how to receive this plan. So gravitational alert. 

**(09:45 Slack obs plan)**
So remember, let's look at this channel, gravitational alert. So remember on lesson 1, you had this GW candidate coming.
We tried to understand all these parameters. And after a while, so you see the alert was received at 8.05 for my local time. And after a while, you will receive this message connected to, for example, 23.01.11 CP.
So three minutes, sometimes it's 10 minutes. Okay, so don't worry, you need to really wait for. And this is tiling.
So we talk about tiling. And here you can see that the telescopes for which the plan has been computed. So 20 fields, which means that we will give them 20 observations to do.
And it corresponds to 40%, for example, for TCH of the credible region, for TRO 27% of the credible region, FSU Auger 12%, and TCA only 1%, and FSU only 5%. 

**(10:56 tiling joint area)**
So if you make the sum of all the percentage that they contain the sources, in fact, you arrive to a probability area of 70% for a total of coverage of the sky of 487 degrees square. So this is quite good.

**(11:31 galaxy targeting slack)**
And also because we can compute this, for example, I give an example about computation of the galaxy targeting. So we will also receive a message. So here I just put one telescope for the test, but you can also receive all the fields.
So remember here at the center of each field, there is the galaxy. Compared to here, there is nothing about galaxy. I think you get it.
(12:07 report on skyportal)
So now I will go to Skyportal. So you will receive the alert in Skyportal. Okay, so this is Skyportal.
Imagine that this is the event. And what you need to do is to go to social and say, so I receive, for example, the alert on Slack, plans produce for yada yada. And then you check like, this is a comment.
And then you receive, you can say like, TCA, hey, as observed, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure that all the things that you have written previously in the logbook will be captured in Skyportal. 

**(13:17 owncloud intro)**
So now I go to, I come back to this gravitational alert. So I go to our enclose.
So you need to have access to enclose. I go, for example, to candidates. So now GW, this is 11 CP.
Sorry, I am a bit ill. And we're going to explore the different folders of OwnCloud because we need to check that. So for example, you have a real event. 

**(13:56 vo events)**
So I will make maybe a video about it. But this is preliminary one because remember that we are at preliminary one here in my example. Sorry.
So we are at preliminary run and you can see, in fact, the message that were sent to the different telescopes automatically. So this is really for automatic telescopes. In this preliminary, you can see, in fact, the different pointing provided to the telescopes.

**(14:36 gwemopt and txt plans)**
So what is interesting is to go to GWEMOPT for you. I go to preliminary. So we have different two type of plans.
This is where we can see the plan. So I go to tiling. And again, you have, in fact, the pointing given to the different telescopes.
So here is TCH. It is called TCH, right? There is 20 fields. Oh, yeah, because remember we said that we are going to give 20 fields.
And so this is the tile ID. So the tile within Skyportal. The ranking, 1, 2, 3. So sometimes the telescopes, they will give you this number or this number.
In Skyportal, I think this is more this number. And then this is the coordinates given to a telescope and the probability. So the ranking.
So you see, the first one has more probabilities than the last one. And so if someone asks you the plan, here it is. It is in the name of the gravitational alert, GWEMOPT, the type of the alert, and tiling. So if someone asks you are the tile and there are different alerts, for example, we are already at the initial. You don't provide preliminary. You give the observation plan corresponding to the most updated sky map.
Okay? So, I mean, it sounds reasonable. So for the galaxy, sorry, for the other teams, for example, for the galaxy targeting. So here in NEMAC, again, you can give if the telescopes team doesn't know where is the plan.
And to help them, we can give this coordinate. So you need to observe that and that and that, et cetera, et cetera. So this is the plan to give to the telescopes team.

**(16:39 provide assistance teams)**
What you need to do, as always, is to go to #observation, say, Hi, we have received an alert. And then, so hi, we have hi channel. We have received an alert.
And then, you contact the team regarding if it is night or not. So to determine if it is night or not. So you look at this plan.

**(17:09 skyportal visibility telescopes)**
You know, I have a map. And you can see that VIRT, OPD, TCH, PRAM, et cetera, they can observe right now. So you will first bother them because it is now this team.
And it is important in Sky Portal, in here, to say, I have contacted nananinanana teams. Because for the next shifter, he will contact the one when it is nighttime. You know, so we don't contact all the team when it is daytime.
Remember, we contact them two hours before it is nighttime. So with Sky Portal, it will really help you to understand which team are during night and daytime. Let me remember what I need to say to you. I think it's done.

**(18:17 skymap plot)**
 So I'm just coming back here. Because in Tiling, for example, there is plots.
And there are interesting plots. So for example, type coverage, EMT mock. You can see, in fact, the probabilities, the sky map.
And you can see the different tilings, what it gives you. So for example, you can see over time which one contributes regarding the pointing. And you can see that it's very joint.
So for example, here, TAO you know, observe some tile, whereas the others are observing something else. So you can check, for example, to understand better the plan about these different plots that you have on the cloud. To understand better what it is going on.
So in case that you are lost, you need to contact your coordinator. And this is it. 

**(19:23 bye)**
So thank you to have listened to me.
And I will make an exercise for you straight away. Thank you.


### 7.5 GW alert and what to observe (telescope teams)

**(00:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone, so this is a video for the telescopes team to help them to understand how to observe a gravitational alert and the counterpart candidate associated to it. 

**(00:59 ways of receiving alerts)**
So in this video, we're going to see how we can receive the gravitational alert from the telescope team's point of view. So remember that there is another video for the follow-up advocate and the shifter that I have prepared for you a week ago.

So how we can receive the gravitational alert and what are the different types of sources that I need to observe. And in another video, so not this one, we're going to see how I can receive the plan and the plan team to observe during gravitational wave campaign. So in this video, which is like first the gravitational wave alert, how I can receive it, how I will be notified that I need to observe with my telescope right now.

So there is a different category, well, way to receive it. So you can receive on Slack and I will come back to that. You can receive independently via calls, via phone, via WhatsApp or via email or because you are not, you are sleeping or I don't know what's happened.

The FA, so the follow-up advocate, the shifter can contact you and say, hey guys, you need to observe straight away right now. So usually we would like that you are independent, right? So there is no need from case number three, but just by Slack or by call, WhatsApp or email. 

**(01:57 gwalert slack and type of messages)**
So we're going to see how to receive it. So it is easy via Slack, I just present Slack. You need to register to GW Alert to receive the notification that there has been an alert. So just I make a pause.

So remember that for GW Alert, there are different kinds of alerts, which means that you can receive different messages, several messages for the same event. So be careful. So I just remind that this is another video that I would like you to watch.

It's first, the message comes from preliminary and then go to initial and then go to update. So there are different messages because when we receive a gravitational alert in LIGO Virgo, we first produce a first like, yeah, the source can be here and then we refine our analysis. So regarding who you are and where you are over the planet, maybe you will observe at the time when the preliminary message is there, or maybe you will observe during the time of an initial.

**(03:14 go or no go)**
Okay, so I would like also to make a point that sometimes we receive a gravitational alert in Slack, but in fact, the localization is too wide. So we are not going to finally observe them within GRANDMA. So sometimes it's no GRANDMA because the alert is the BBH and the localization accuracy is not very good.
That's why the FA will not necessarily contact you or will not necessarily interact with you because it's not very interesting. So there are some preferences on how it is urgent to observe, how it is urgent to wake up as a telescope still. So it's mostly for the BNS and NSBH case.

It's mostly for events with distance located quite closer to us, like less than 200 megaparsec, and when the localization area is less than 200 degrees square. Okay, but as a telecom team, you can always observe. It's not, no, it's forbidden to observe.

You just use that to choose when you want to observe. And I would like to also make a point that because we are trying to practice, maybe it's better at the beginning to try to practice and observe some not urgent alerts because it's good for everyone to train. 

**(04:47 transition)**
Okay, so we are still on the gravitational wave alert section, and I would like to show you how to get this alert in Slack and in Skyportal and how to parameterize Skyportal.

So let me show you. So I go to first Slack. So as I said, you need to go to GW Alert.

**(05:33 slack gwalert channel)**
So in GW Alert, you have GW Candidate. For example, this is a message that you can receive. I have made another video to show you what does it mean.

But anyway, it's just a message that tells you that there has been a gravitational wave coming, and there is no plan here. You cannot access to the plan. After a while, so dozens of minutes, like 15 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes, you will also receive some kind of message, which means that the plan has been produced for GRANDMA.

It has been produced, and you can straight away observe it, pick up the observation plan and upload. But I will make another video for it. 

**(06:26 slack #skyportal-alerts)**
I also invite you to register to ICARE Skyportal. Here you will receive also the event. It is a duplication. It is exactly the same as GW Alert, but sometimes our systems are not very reliable, so it's better to register to ICARE.

**(06:47 not to type on gwalert channel)**
At the telescope scene, do not write on this channel. It is only for notification, so forbidden to write on this channel. If you have some questions, go to observation and not GW Alert and not ICARE Alert. I don't know where it is now. And not Skyportal Alert forbidden. 

**(07:27 register on icare-skyportal the notifications)**
Now I will go to our ICARE platform to help you to parameterize, so it's only in ICARE that parameterize this ICARE, so that you connect by Slack, that you can receive the plan by email, by WhatsApp, making your calling, etc.

And I will show you how to parameterize your ICARE Skyportal. So you go to your name, the profile, and then you go down. So me, I have registered my number, because I would like to receive it by WhatsApp or making a call or text message.

And you need, like me, to go to source and to GCN event. So to source me, I have selected Go Grandma high priority. GW Candidate, GW Consultant, Not GW Candidate, Stop Grandma and Go Grandma.

To have the same tag as me, you just need to select like this. And then it appears. And then, so for example, if you have already something, you click to update. And then you need to click to this button. So why? Because you see there that you will say, yeah, I would like to receive the message by Slack or by SMS. So this is more for the FA.

Anyhow, you can plug in here and by phone call if you want. So for example, by phone call, on shift, or you can define maybe your time slot or by WhatsApp. This is everything that you want. You do it like this. And then you really need to press the button update. Otherwise, it won't be recorded.

So then this is sources. So sources is not a gravitational wave. The sources are just like pointing, but we will see why it is very important to have it. And then to receive the first alert from GW event, you need to click on GCN event. So GCN equals GW equals GCN. Okay. So here, for example, I will create a new profile. So this is my new profile or like me, grandma, grandma go, for example. Even filtering. So we will do it together.

So everything that is LVC, not test because LVC retraction, perfect. Then I will select go-grandma, GW, perfect. And this is it for the moment. Maybe LVC. This is also great. Not maybe LVC. GW for grandma. Property nothing. And yeah. And then create. So I can create. You see, I have now grandma go. This is because I will receive the alert. I mean, I have parameterized this to receive the alert. 

And then I need to say how I'm going to receive the alert by email or message on Slack or by SMS. Yes. No. Sorry. By phone call on shift, for example. Or if you're telescope time, you just like say like your time slot. So for example, I have a shifter. I think this is in UTC. So you can, yeah, you can, for example, join my data. And then I click on, yeah, I think it's over. I think it has been taken. And this is it.

Okay. I also advise you to click on observation plan because you are telescope team. And again, you need to click on characteristic. So this is for understanding how I can receive the alert. Now I would like to come back to section number two. It's observation. Observation.

**(11:56 intro: what to observe in GW ?)**
 So as I said, remember in the beginning of my video, there is. So we are going to observe in the GW.


**(12:06 GW skymap recap)**
And this is another video that you can observe. But GW alert is not only a very accurate pointing. It's a very wide localization area over the sky.

So you cannot just only observe only one pointing. This is impossible. We need to have GRANDMA observing different parts of this localization area.

We call it, and the FA will call it, the sky map. Sky map is just a region of the sky to observe for a GW event. And you see this 90%.

It means that this contour within the sky, there is 90% chance that the event is contained in this contour. So me, imagine that I am on the FRAM team. I will receive different pointing.

One, two, three. You see in orange, in pink. Compared to TCR that we also receive other pointing.

This square represents the field of view of your telescope. That's why I'm asking you your size of your field of view. So in fact, what does it mean? It means that me as TARO, as TCA, I don't receive the same plan as FRAM.

So don't ask what is the plan or why I don't have the same coordinate as the others. Because in fact, each individual has different plan. Most of you have a smaller field of view.

So if we spend our time with your small field of view, scale the sky map, it will take ever and it is not efficient. That's why we will point a targeted galaxy that is located at the distance of the GW event. And again, it is for example in red by SAO.

And this is the galaxy targeting strategy. And you need to point this galaxy. So you have a galaxy in the center of your field of view. Sometimes the galaxy is not visible. So you see nothing. 

**(14:15 galaxies and tiling)**
So what does it mean as a reminder? So me, if I am in SHAO team, I don't have the same plan.

I have several coordinates. So not only one coordinate, several coordinates. And my plan is different than LEMAC observation plan. So it is not only, well, I don't see in GW alert, the coordinate. Because in fact, you have a different plan for each telescope. So this plan, we will pick up it in output. This is in another video. But this is very important. So I think you started to understand that there is a galaxy.

So maybe you will receive different galaxy with S. So several points for GW alert. So galaxy are here in this image, this red. If you have a narrow field of view, less than one degree. So this is most of the people. Or you have tilings with S. So which means that you have a wider field of view. And this, again, you will have different points to observe.

**(15:43 when to observe ?)**
So this search, so when you receive a galaxy targeting plan, or a timing plan, you need to do it in less than 24 hours. So imagine that GW alert comes. And this is a night, and it is cloudy, and you cannot observe.

Then if you say, yeah, I will observe the next day. It's already too late. Don't observe it anymore. Don't observe it, because it's not worth. You will need to go to the third category of sources. So first category, galaxy.

Second category, tiling. Some of you just received galaxy. Some of you received just tiling. Some of you can receive both. And this, the plan is less than 24 hours after the gravitational alert comes. And if you cannot observe them for any reason, the telescope is broken, or I can't have some plan, because sometimes the source, the localization is not accessible to your telescopes, you need to go for the search of GW source candidate, equal-equal transient.

And this search goes, you need to observe it in 72 hours, with a delay of 72 hours from the first message associated to this gravitational alert. 

**(17:14 Transient source candidates)**
So this is some candidate. So that I call GW candidate, and this is very important.

This candidate, you won't have it on Slack. You will receive it by email, because the FA, so this is an action of the FA, it will transmit you which candidate you need to observe. So this is something that the FA will tell you, either in observation, either you will receive an email. And this is very important, because in fact, you will, during an offer, you will really observe this GW source candidate. 

**(17:52 summary)**
So again, there is not only one GW source candidate, which means that, for example, if I am SHAO, I will observe a candidate that is different from UBE, or different from OPD, you know, so everyone has different things to do. This is very important, because you need to get it.

So I think I have done with all this first overview. And see you for the next video, when I will show you all the plan to receive the galaxy-targeting pointing and tying. So just as a recap, as a recap, as a recap.

So let me find my paper. So as a telescope team, you will receive different pointings, either observing galaxies, either performing tying. You need to do it within 24 hours.

And this, if you cannot observe, you need to say it in the Slack, on the observation, in Skyportal. I will show you how to do that just in a minute. And after, you move.

So if you cannot observe this promptly, you wait for message from the FA or by email to observe some GW source candidate. When the FA says stop, you need to stop everything, etc., etc.

**(19:36 interact with FAs)**
So for the candidate, you can have a message here from the FA to observe a source.

When you receive a GW alert, you can say like, so you need to say, you cannot say, I can't observe, right? This is not good. You say OPD, so you remind the name of the telescope for OPD one meter, cannot observe for today, you know, something like this, you know, so that the FA can record. Or if you are a bit, I mean, which is make easier everyone, is to directly go to the gravitational alert.

So for example, this is a gravitational alert. I go to social and I make a comment like OPD 1.5 meter, cannot observe this source within the next 24 hours. You know, this is a comment that I make, add comment, or something different.

So me as a telescope team, I have also TAO, so I said this to her as observe source XXX, etc., etc., to help the FA to understand what is your, what are you doing, you know, or plan or TCF plan, TCF plan to observe, to observe tonight. Okay, so thank you everyone. I will post that and if you have questions, please let me know and I'll switch to the technique straight away.

Thank you.


## 7.6 Plans, Images, Photometry (telescope teams)

**(00:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone, so now I'm going to show you how to have access to the plan of your observation.

**(00:11 prequeries which observations)**
 So remember that in the last video we were talking about the different type of observations that you can make, either within the galaxy, in the field of view, or just tiling in the field of view. This observation should be done within 24 hours, and if you cannot observe during these 24 hours, you need to only observe the gravitational wave source candidates, or what we call the transients, that the FA and the shifter will guide you which candidates you need to observe.

And this within 72 hours, and in case of that the contemporary has been detected, you need to follow up as deep as you can the candidates, but we will have another prize. 

**(01:10 tasks of telescope teams)**
So let me now see the different steps that I would like to show you in this video. So we have notify, so we show in the last video how to get notified from Skyportal, and you need to tell the FA, the follow-up advocate, in observation that you will or will not, you receive or you did not receive the alert.

Of course if you're sleeping or it's not the time that you're going to perform observation, you can say, yeah, we're observing a delay, or you check the weather. So the first step is to get notified, but also to notify the people that you're going to observe or not within 24 hours. The second task that you need to do is observing, the most funny part maybe, either galaxy or tilings or candidates in the 24 hours, 72 hours, depending on where you are.

And then number three of your task is to submit as soon as they come the image. So remember that for the image we need the astrometry in it, not only just whole image without dark, black, etc. So this is very important, the image.

And then within the next two days, three days, the photometry results. So now I'm going to share my screen, I'm going to show in my screen where you can, so notify, we already saw it in the last video, so just observe. So the observation plan, so let me go to my... So now I am, so remember that we have this alert, 230511CP.

Normally you have been notified by, sorry, it's in GW. 

**(03:23 access observation plan slack)**
So normally you have been notified because you're registered in GW alert. This is the first message preliminary.
And in the last video, I show you that how to receive the alert via Skyportal or via Slack or via phone. And then after a while, you see, so as I said, in the next 10, 15 minutes, you have this plan coming. And you can click on link, on the link.

So I click on the link, like I can do like you. 

**(04:00 owncloud presentation)**
And you see, so the name of the event, 230511CP. So this is true.

You have the different folder that you know about. Image, you can see image, logbook, new event. So logbook, it is where you're going to upload the photometry.

And GWEMOPT, in fact, is a new folder. So I click here. 

**(04:25 gwemopt)**
You have here two folders.

So if alert just come, there is just one. This is preliminary. You see, it's arrived earlier than this one because it's the first message.

So if I click on preliminary, I have access to two folders. Galaxy targeting and tiling. So if I go back, for example, I am TCA.

So I received a plan from tiling. So I go to tiling. And then I have access to my plan here.

And so you can see, it's not only one point that I need to follow up. Here is five fields. So you have the name, so TCA.

Yeah, it's me because I need to have started with TCA. Rank ID, one, two, three, four, five. So usually the one is the one with the best chance to have the source candidate in it.

The gravitational wave counterpart in it. And then you have tile ID. So this is more technical.

It is for us. So don't take care of it. And then you have the coordinate when you point the telescope.

So this is the center of, you need to point the telescope within the center. So within the center of this tile. And then you have, so the probability.

To, so sorry, this is RA/DEC, sorry. So this is RA and DEC. And this is a probability that the source is within this field.

And here, this is the tile according to your telescopes, because this is only a plan for TCA, for which you can observe. So for example, it can be observed at 8 UTC, of course, because TCA can observe during when it is around this time in France. So like 10 p.m. And I can, so all this tile I can observing straight away.

Sometimes you can see that a tile, it's better to observe the tile at the beginning because here it gives you really the scheduling, in fact. So even if this tile is more important to observe, maybe it's not the first one that you can observe within your night. And so if I am another telescope, you see, so the ops time will be different because, of course, Thierry, which is in La Réunion, so in India, the Pacific, in the Indian Sea, I don't remember how to say it, or the ocean, can observe earlier.

So if you are regarding who you are, you need to pick up the plan and start observation within. So for example, me, I would like to observe TCA. 

**(07:55 notify FA in skyportal)**
So I go to observation.

And I said, I received the plan. And I will start observing with TCA. And it's good to say ID 1 and tile ID, for example.

Tile ID, so ID 1 and tile ID. Okay. So this, I can also, as we saw last time, to put it here and add comment.

Because it's better because we keep it. So it's better, it's good to do in both ways, but it's better to do it in I-Care if you just want to do it for one. So I am doing the observation.

And so imagine, sorry, so I am looking at the plan. It's good to say from preliminary. And it's good one to check which plan and maybe to put the coordinate of the source.

So let me go back. Sorry. Tiling.

TCA, so the first one, this one. Okay. Why? Because, so it comes to my second point.

**(09:38 update vs preliminary)**
Maybe, so for example, I am TCA. I cannot observe right now. It is only 1 p.m. in France.

So maybe later, there will be an updated plan, as I said. So an updated plan for which the coordinates won't be the same. And this is a problem because I'm sure that some of you will confuse.

And you need to be very vigilant. So that's why it's good to, yeah, to copy-paste. Maybe just simply restart TCA and you just copy-paste this line.

So that everyone understands and there is no confusion. Okay. Okay.

So if, for example, tonight I see that there is an update, then I took the observation from the update plan. I won't took the one from the preliminary. And how do you know if there is a new plan or not? So it is again, if I go back to #gwalerts.

Yeah. So for example, this was a message from the preliminary. You see, preliminary.

But after a while, up, there has been another message from the same candidate. 230511cp. You see that it is an update.

And you see that the plan has been computed again. So you need to be very careful. So the plan is different.

For example, here it was 5 field, 7.3% of observation of the total credible region. While in this file, it was only 1%. For here, I computed more test scores.

But anyway, you need to be very, very learned for which plan you need to take when you start observation. Because if you don't start observation immediately, you need to wait. As TCA, it's better to take the most updated plan, the update one.

In any case, you have some problem to understand which plan you need to use, just contact the FA in observation. So like, I am confused about the plan. Okay.

**(12:23 reporting images)**
So imagine now you have observe, and you have an image. I have prepared something for you. So I have an image, and I need to upload it.

So again, I go to image, stack, and then I upload in my image. So as you see, so this is my image from TCA. But this is a wrong name.

As you see, we have a real, I mean, we have a way to name fit image in GRANDMA. So my image should start. So maybe, okay.

**(13:33 naming images)**
My image should be in the way of the name of the GW alert. So GW alert. My name as observer, the name of the telescopes, the time I have observed.

So I have observed, we say at 20. In which filters, if it is stack, so yes, then the number of image per exposure time. And here, I added this number.

So it corresponds to the pointing of the source. So if you, normally it's, so this is, yeah. And this is DEC.

So for a question of format is, I ask you to put this between so that we have our stuff. So which means that this is a coordinate that you have, I mean, the coordinates you have observed because you have different coordinates, different pointing to observe. So if you just put, if you put just nothing, then I need to report for a report.

That's fine because I have observed this. So I put again in my name. Okay.

To be sure that we understood that this image is, okay. So maybe this will change, but for the moment, we will keep it like this. And so I need to rename my GRANDMA that fits in with this name.

So I go to image type. Okay. Okay.

So let's see the OwnCloud. I mean, in the web, you can see that. Yeah.

So it has a good name. Sarah is happy. Maybe there are two time bits.

So we'll do it properly. So this is the correct name. What else? So then the second thing you need to do.

**(16:19 photometry in owncloud)**
So yeah, remember that this, it needs to be with astrometry. And then I need to upload my CSV, my result. So you need to create this by here.

I just created to show you. So I need to say which time I observe. Okay.

So can I turn it now? So I will turn it here. Which time I observe. So it was 25, 11.

You need to make it more property, but here is just an example. TCA. Here I put the filter that I, so here is MGD.

So you need to convert it. Here I put the filter clean in from Skyportal, et cetera, et cetera. As we did last time.

And I have done, this is me that done analysis. But for GW, you need to add as well the coordinate of the source once again. Because you will have multiple photometry.

So the source was that I observe. This one, again, this is the image corresponding to this one. And I've done my photometry for that.

So I just go back. Okay. And I add the source here at the beginning.

So here I am happy. And you need to do that because you have, so let me read. In logbook.

So you need to create that because you don't have, so you see the source is there now. And you need to create this file as a telescope team. Sorry, I'm getting a bit tired.

Because this is your role and the follow-up advocate will help you. But anyway, this is your task to do. 

**(18:49 photometry in skyportal)**
There is also another way to register, for example, some observation.

Is to go by Skyportal via this formula. I think you're already trained. If you need help, I need to do another video.

So thank you everyone to have listened to me for this technical part. And bye-bye.


## 7.7 GW source candidates - Transients (follow-up advocate)

**(00:00 Introduction)**
 Hello everyone, so now I would like to give the training, so this is for the follow-up advocates, part 3, and we're going to talk about the source candidates.

**(00:15 Source GW candidate : what is it ?)**
So, the source candidates, counterpart candidates, is what I call the source candidates. It comes after when there is a gravitational wave alert.

 First, you have message preliminary that happens within minutes, so after a gravitational wave is detected, you have the message within minutes. Then, remember that GRANDMA will automatically provide an observation plan, either with tiling, either with galaxy targeting, that will happen from 10 to 40 minutes after the first message, and the team needs to observe this within 24 hours. After that, there is no need to observe.

But because of this search, there will be some candidates within the counterpart that will be found, either by GRANDMA, either by other team, and this is what we call GW source candidates, so either by other team, either by GRANDMA, and we ask the telescope team of GRANDMA to observe them within 72 hours. 

So this is two types of observation, or even three types, galaxy tilings within 24 hours, and then gravitational source candidates within 72 hours. So this step, what is this step? It's just to find if among these source candidates, there is the counterpart of the gravitational wave alert, and we just follow this one.

 But for that, we need to observe them to see how it will fade, to see if this source candidate is the gravitational wave counterpart, or finally, it's just something like that. Remember, we have done that already with FINK during the training. Remember, FINK paper, and etc, etc.

So, these source candidates, just to recap, if someone is lost. So we have the 90% credible region provided by LIGO VIRGO. Then we're going to pave it, or we're going to check some interesting galaxies, and then this first step leads to some source candidates that we will follow, which means that all the telescopes of GRANDMA cannot observe all these sources.

The number of sources can vary, like from 1, from 0, to 20, let's say, 20, 50. It depends from different teams, so it's not only GRANDMA, in the others. And sometimes during the follow-up, we see that it's not the gravitational wave counterpart.

**(03:15 Select the source candidate )**
 or other teams say, oh no, it's not the gravitational wave counterpart, and so we need to stop observation also in GRANDMA.
.
So, how do you know that it is interesting? Why GRANDMA will follow this gravitational wave counterpart? So I'm just here, okay? Gravitational wave counterpart. Okay, so why do we need that it is interesting? So, we will read the GCN, maybe in the message sent by other teams, they say, yeah, it's so nice, it's so interesting, maybe it's sure, there is high probability that this is the counterpart. So serious, go, go, go, go, go, GRANDMA.

Sometimes in the message provided by the other team, it is, yeah, maybe this is just, but we don't know, we don't know the color, yeah, this is okay, we just send one or two telescopes of GRANDMA. 

Also, if you would like to say, do I ask GRANDMA to follow up these source candidates or not, you need to tell how many sources we are already observing GRANDMA. If we have already five sources and this source is not very interesting, it's not worth to trigger GRANDMA.

And then, ask, if you are lost, ask your weekly coordinator, like always, that will tell you what to do.

**(04:29 Timeline)**
 So I just like put in this paper the timeline, just to be sure that you have understood. So imagine that, oh no, this is not this one, imagine that we are at this alert, so remember GW is not starting with GW, it's starting with S, this is the 3rd, June 26th, 23rd, so imagine that we are in that situation, there is a gravitational wave alert coming.

The first source, for example, receives a gravitational wave alert. So it receives it and it receives a plan, it decides to follow up or not. Then the follow up advocate number 2, so for example it is you, you won't just like choose wait, oh, I'm waiting another alert, remember? You will maybe send the plan of Galaxy tiling for telescope that were during daytime, during that time, but need to observe something.

So this is you that decide whether or not they will observe it, regarding how it goes, if the source is very interesting or not. Then we have FA number 3, so because they have been already starting observation down, I mean, since 12 hours, you know, because from the FA1 to FA3 there is 12 hours, maybe there is some candidate proposed by GRANDMA or external. To be honest, we are trying to provide candidate from GRANDMA, but usually we can't, so we just follow up candidate from the external community.
But this is a secret, okay? So remember that, so imagine that there is a team that say, yeah, I have a source candidate from GW. So this comes from FA3, but still from this alert. So you need to do something.
And then FA number 4, you receive, you also look at the GCN, so the report from other team. And he saw that there is another interesting alert, so he will deal with this source candidate. But FA3 can also maybe, FA4 can also look at this candidate number 1. So this is really a team, okay? You just need not to wait, and yeah, you need to contact people.
And maybe FA number 4 will see that finally soure candidate number 1 is not any more interesting to follow up, so he needs to stop things within GRANDMA.

**(06:52 Summary)**
 So now just as a recap recap, because I like to make recap for you. I just need my paper.
So now I will show in the computer how to do this different step. I mean, see what the other team are doing, or GRANDMA. Register the source from Skyportal.

Whether or not we're going to follow up with GRANDMA. How to stop observation in GRANDMA. And check the photometry.

**(07:21 GCN)**
Okay, so let's go now. So now, so first, remember in my just presentation, we go to nasa.gcn.gov. You have this page. So you need to first sign in.

I don't show how to sign in. Everyone knows how to sign in to a website. And for example, me, I go, you go then to profile, email notification, I think.

And I turn off, so it was off. I turn off and turn on circular. Okay, so this is the thing that you need to do.

So that you will receive by email all the message from NASA, GCN NASA. And in GCN NASA, you will receive this kind of image. 

**(08:09 GCN Circulars)**
You see, so maybe I go. Okay, I go. So the last message that was sent to all the list was Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor Trigger. Okay, nothing related with GW.

So last, last one, GRB. Okay, nothing related to GW. Another different alert. No, not GW. Ah, LIGO Virgo. Yeah, GW.
S230522N, Global Master Net Observation. So usually, we don't care about master. So we don't take care.

And then there is this one associated to this alert. So you see, master was associated to 0522N. And here, it is associated to 18H.

So for example, I am the shifter. I look at this GCN. So you see, blah, blah, blah, blah. So he said that SWIFT observation candidates began 73 hours. So you see, it's very old. But no matter what, we're going to try to say, imagine that it's very interesting.

We're going to try to record this target. No, it's not very interesting because we don't have the coordinates. So I will find another example nicer.

**(09:31 Add a source in skyportal)**
So this one. So we look at 21K. Okay. And he proposed two candidates. And these are the coordinates. Okay.

So I go to ICARE. And I go down. We see add source. Grandma. Yeah. Object.

So object is this one, we said. So I took that name. If there is two names, you just select your favorite one. Okay. So. Okay.

So then you tell me, right ascension, declination. So right ascension. Oh. Oh. Declination. 

Submit. I submit. So save. So usually I advise you to always reload a bit the page.
So we are happy because there is a new source. It's my source that I have added.

**(10:49 Add photometry from the GCN)**
If you would like, because we see the photometry. So the photometry is 15.56J. You can go to this page. No, sorry. To that page.

Because here we just create the coordinate. And we can upload photometry via the form. Here you will select Grandma.

Observation that the one that were said. So sometimes they don't say it. But yeah. Maybe this one. If it is, it needs to be in UTC. So you need to convert it. I don't do it now. What is important is to have the origin. Sorry.

The instrument you click on generic. Okay. Because generic is a GCN. Generic GCN. Okay. And then when the form is done, you click to submit.
So this is what you need to do. 

**(11:52 Comment and ask observations)**
And then to ask a telescope's team to observe. So it's like, hi, I have created this source.

And you can put here the subject. So that we know where it comes from, etc., etc. So once again. And the number. Okay. Ah.

And then this is ICARE, yeah. And if it's really interesting, you can wake up everyone by saying, Go Grandma, probability one. And then if I go back to dashboard, you see my source.
And go Grandma.

**(12:57 Stop observations)**
If, for example, you're on the next shifter and you show in the circular, someone saying, no, finally, it's not very interesting. Or it is like today that we have no feedback from no one.
You select Stop Grandma. And you go there. And you say.

Or you can say, or I can say. Toto, this is a name. Lily, can you confirm with TCA that, so it's a telescope that they will observe.

No? Or TCA told me that they have uploaded the image. You know, this kind of stuff.

**(14:34 Send an observation plan to one telescope)**
 If you want to send only an observation plan for someone, or someone from the team would like to send it to themselves, you can, for example, I select TAO.

Grandma, okay, PS1, super, perfect. I want to observe it today. And for tomorrow. And I click Submit. Okay. And when I go to, which one am I? You see, I have a plan submitted.

Usually there is this thing, so it's a bug, don't worry, but it is submitted. And so what does it mean? So this person, I mean, you select TAO, so TAO is me. 

So if I go back to my email, you see, because it was Go Grandma, I received a first email to say that it was Go Grandma.

And I received another personal message because you triggered me, you see. And also Salome and Alain. So this is the way to contact him.

**(15:46 Telescope teams contact)**
So people will ask me, yeah, but I don't know who is contacted. So you can go to Allocation. And this is all the telescopes in Grandma.

And if I go there, so Allocation, okay, Allocation. And you see who is registered. So the telescope team can modify this page.

Maybe it's not up to date, but this is something that we can see.

**(16:18 Associate to the GW event)**
 So something also interesting to do is, for example, this, remember, this event was associated to 18H. So we can go up and find out 18H.

So, for example, it's a bit old. So I go through GCN. So it's GWGRB Neutrino. And I put 013, 05. Do we have something? CDH, yeah, this is this one. No.

Looks strange, but anyway. And here, to the corresponding alert, you can write a message. I have added a source in Skyportal related to that event. For example.

**(17:41 Report GCN results in skyportal)**
 Okay, so this is good to always keep track on things. The question is, so I suggest from the GCN effect, which would be very, very good, is like, you just like start.

And as soon as there are GCN related to the event, you just copy-paste them and mention them in Skyportal. So, for example, if I took a, oh, so it was 21K. Okay, so we cannot do that.

Anyway, so just check that this is the correct event, because here, this is 21K. But I make a mistake, because this is not 21K, this is 18R. So I made a mistake, so I can delete my comment.
And I can go back to find 21K. Search. This is 21K.

So, we're there. And you can do that so that the next shifter can understand when a look that I have, I create some source for that. So, if, for example, the source was not interesting, but you add it, 

**(19:38 When you decide not to follow-up)**
you can make a statue like Notacare, you know, so that, you know, it will help GRANDMA to understand.

So, let me see if I have sent, yeah. So now, the telescopes team, imagine that they have observed something. So remember that in the last campaign, there was needed to add in the logbook the photometry.

**(20:03 Photometry from GRANDMA)**
So here, if they give you the, for example, this year, that the photometry is at ###. So, if they told you that, or if they do that in the logbook, you can, yourself, using the same formula as last time, and enter the corresponding instrument. Okay, so it's really better to do it via Skyportal.

Or, you can look, and I will ask the telescopes team to do that, at the logbook, when normally they have uploaded a file that looks like, that looks like, that looks like this. When you have the source, and maybe they can provide the name of the source, maybe. Here, name of the source.

They have provided in which filter they have observed, and the magnitude. So, if they provide that in a file, maybe it is easier. But any case, you, the FA, is responsible to add all the photometry that is within GCN.

Okay, because you need to do that. And maybe you can, at the end of your shift, saying that I have stopped looking at GCN up to, for example, So, for example, me is 97. 3-3-8-5-7.
3-3-8-5-7. 3-3-8-5-7. 3-3-8-5-7.

You know, so that the next shifter can understand that you are there. Okay, so this is the big stats of the FA. Of course, you cannot be just on your screen and just, like, say, yeah, I'm looking at my email, but you can, you know, look regularly, like, every, like, two or three times during your shift.

**(22:37 Bonus: send circular)**
Got it? The last one that I would like to show you is, like, with this NASAGov circular view, this is also the way that we will send the circular to everyone. So, there was some bug during Goal 3. This is for part number 4. It will be managed by your weekly coordinator, but at least we capture the candidate sequence. So, thank you for your time.
I will pause this video right now and take care of you. Bye.


## 7.8 GW alert: different types

**(0:00 Introduction)**
Today, I would like to talk about the gravitational wave alerts and in this video we are going to understand what it means gravitational wave alert. In this video, we are going to see how we can be notifies and what are the different types of gravitational wave alerts. 

**(0:23 Notify)**
To be notified in GRANDMA as FA, you need to be registered to #gwalerts channel on slack. In this channel, you will receive different types of alerts.

**(0:40 Preliminary)**
The first type of alert you will receive when an event is detected by LVK is a PRELIMINARY alert. This alert arrives when the objects has already collided and the system on LVK takes a few second to a few minutes to process. This is the PRELIMINARY alert that and it has a skymap associated with it. This way  we can point our telescopes. 

**(1:25 Early)**
LVK, in fact, before the PRELIMINARY has also delivered publicly an early warning alert. We do not follow up in GRANDMA because there is no skymap associated with it so its not worth it to listen. The early warning happened before the PRELIMINARY.

**(1:58 Preliminary)**
 In GRANDMA, we focus on the PRELIMINARY alert. If you are a shifter, you receive a PRELIMINARY warning on #gwalerts. 

**(2:15 Initial)**
The gravitational wave experts in LVK also receive the PRELIMINARY alert and they are woken up to understand whether or not it comes from an astrophysical event or not. After a while, they’re going to send an INITIAL alert. For the INITIAL, it happens in several dozens of minutes, to one hour, to several hours and sometimes INITIAL is not sent to the community or is never received by GRANDMA. It is important because in case it is finally not astrophysics you will receive a retraction from the INITIAL statues. 

**(3:11 Update)**
After hours or one day, we receive an UPDATE alert from the same event. From the same event: we have PRELIMINARY, INITIAL and UPDATE alerts. So, when you're a shifter, you can receive an UPDATE alert where the previous alerts occurred during a previous shift.


**(3:42 Deal with all the alerts)**
So, as a shifter, you need to treat all the alerts, whether you have received PRELIMINARY alerts during your shift or not. 

**(3:56 Skymaps)**
In the UPDATE, we use all the parameter space of gravitational waves to construct the skymap. This skymap and the localization error is different from the INITIAL and PRELIMINARY. In fact, in our grandma paper, we use the update skymap to produce our results. But, we usually follow up with the PRELIMINARY and the INITIAL. Usually, the PRELIMINARY and INITIAL has the same skymap. The INITIAL skymap is a confirmation of the PRELIMINARY skymap. Sometimes, the skymap is different and as a FA you may need to redirect some kind of viewpoints after the initial. Usually, the update arrives too late to change the plan because the plan is already finished and the UPDATE is only for the paper. 

**(05:06 Conclusions)**
You will be notified by the #gwalerts. You will receive PRELIMINARY which is extremely important, and the one that we wake up to. You can then face an INITIAL that will tell you if an event is astrophysical or not. Then, several hours later you will receive an UPDATE that provides the final skymap. 


## 7.9 Non-European weekly coordinators : How to create a shift in Skyportal

**(00:00 - 00:45)** I would like to create a video for a person that would like to be a weekly coordinator but is not working in Paris time or in Europe time. And I would like to show how to create a shift when you are not in Europe. So let me share my screen. 

**(00:45 - 1:16)**  Here first you need to connect to skyportal-icare.ijclab.in2p3.fr and you go to the screen and then you go down to the shift - Dashboard, Sources, Candidate and Shifts. I click here. For the moment what you see is, this kind of things, may you don’t have the same scale here because you are not working in Paris time zone. You have something different. 

**(1:16 - 1:33)** And if I go next, next, next, I see some slots that are already filled, because in fact me Sarah, I have already filled the slots and I see only the ones that I am associated with. For example, my filled slots, nice. 

**(1:33 - 1:53)** If I would like to see all the shifts, then I click on show all the shifts up, show all shifts. And then I see all the shifts from my other colleagues. So for example, this one is with admin Martin Blazek. Whereas this one is me.

**(1:53 - 2:16)** Here the idea today is to know how to create a shift on a week when you are not in France or in Europe. The shift does not start from Monday to Sunday. It starts from Thursday to the next Thursday,

**(2:16 - 2:55)** thats why for this slot, thats called Kenza team start on Thursday night in Paris and ends on Thursday afternoon. So it always start at 6 pm French time. So 4 pm UTC time. So now I will show how to create this slot when you are not in Paris but when you are in USA or in Asia. 

**(2:55 - 3:42)** So for example, if I like to be a weekly coordinator and I want to create the shift from Thursday 3rd to Thursday 10th. So I am not in Paris, so I don’t see the same Paris time. I clicked on add new shift on top right and choose group “GRANDMA”, shift name party, number of users 2, description nothing, divide it by day - very important, and then here it is not local time, it is UTC time. Then we are 8, 8 in 8. It starts in August and finished in August. 

**(3:42 - 4:36)** It starts on Thursday 3rd, and finished on Wednesday 9 for the moment. So the first slot in UTC will start at 4 pm and will finish at 10. I just do that because we don’t want overlap. So 4 to this, divide it by day, 2 slots, Party, GRANDMA. Everything is fine. 

**(4:36 - 5:07)** So I click submit. And then I have slots here and arriving here. So you see in my view in Paris time, it perfectly fit the other shifter’s slot. So then I will create this slots. But for the next slots, I decided that I will be available as weekly coordinator to also to question to beginner shifter/Followup Advocate. 


## 7.10 European weekly coordinator How to create a shift in Skyportal

**(0:00 - 0:18)**
Hello everyone, I hope that you're fine. So I'm gonna show you how to set up some shift as weekly coordinator. So weekly coordinator, this video is for weekly coordinators, not for shift weekly coordinator.

**(0:19 - 0:47)**
So let me share my screen. Yeah, one second, I'm sharing the screen. So this is Skyportal, so you need to log on Skyportal, iCare, edclab.ein2p3.fr. And here on the dashboards, there is dashboard, GW, GRB, Neutrino, sources, candidate, favorite, and shift.

**(0:47 - 1:16)**
You click on shift. So normally it is like this, and to show some shift from everyone to see then the slot is visible, you click show all shift. So now we're gonna create, find a slot on shift from May 7, 13 to, so this period is up to August 27.

**(1:18 - 1:53)**
So I will put a slot, let me delete this. So to delete, for example, some slot because I was mistaken, you can do like this, okay. So I would like to, sorry, I would like to create some new shifts in that period because I would like to be a weekly coordinator from 6th of July, Thursday to 13th of July, Thursday.

**(1:55 - 2:06)**
So for that, I will create a new shift. So add new shift. I will find the group GRANDMA and then the shift name, whatever you like.

**(2:06 - 2:18)**
So piupiu, number of user required for the shift. So for this shift at play time, there will be only one shifter and me coordinator. So one plus one, so two.

**(2:19 - 2:26)**
So I put two, three plus question, we don't care. Divide per day, very important to put it. And local time.

**(2:26 - 2:48)**
And here, maybe you don't see the same screen as me because here it is with French time. But obviously, if you go with UTC, it will be with another, in another, it will be another display. So now I use, so I need to put like July 6 with some.

**(2:49 - 3:29)**
So this is the slot of eight, this and this, this. And seven, so seven up to, let's say Thursday, 13th. Thursday, 13th.

**(3:29 - 3:48)**
So Thursday, 13th, no, Thursday, 12th, sorry. Because it's starting on six, but finishing the slot on 12. So 12, and then I need to put 23, 59.

**(3:49 - 3:58)**
59, it's very important not to have overlap. Seven, 12, so I think it's fine. And I'm gonna add it.

**(3:59 - 4:15)**
So now I have my slots. Then I would like to be, so I will be shifter now. So me and another person will be shifter from 12 to six.

**(4:16 - 4:27)**
So I will add, and this is the slot. So if I am with the coordinator and on shift, I will add someone else. I will add something in the description.

**(4:27 - 4:49)**
So I show you, so GRANDMA, shift name, again, piupiu. Then the number of user is the same, but here it's slots only for beginner. Slots only for beginner, yeah.

**(4:49 - 5:17)**
Divided by day, local time. And then I put seven, seven. So this now will not start on six, it will start on seven because it is, we start the shift during 6 p.m. So then the first date for this weekly slot is on seven.

**(5:19 - 5:43)**
So seven, seven, seven, no, not seven, sorry. Seven, so we will up to 13, you see, 13, okay. So here it is, 17, 59, yes.

**(5:45 - 6:02)**
And, and, and, and, 12, 12, okay. So this is my local time, divided by day. Slots only for beginner, GRANDMA, piupiu, and then isolated.

**(6:03 - 6:12)**
So here we go, there is these things up to Thursday. So we are good. Okay, good luck with yours.

**(6:12 - 6:32)**
And the last point is that you do not only have one slot regarding the LOI. If you ask either to be weekly coordinator every month, you need to put like four if it is every eight weeks. So just manage, it's not only putting one slot, it's about like what you have written in your LOI.

**(6:33 - 6:35)**
Thank you everyone, and bye-bye.


## 7.11 Managing the ZTF candidates (follow-up advocate training)

**(0:02 - 0:15)**
So hello, Grandma. So after a presentation I made on the Grandma Telecon of Thursday, I was asked to make a video about the ZTF candidates management. So here it is.

**(0:16 - 0:31)**
So the topic of this video is to explain or give some information about how to deal with ZTF counterpart candidate. And basically, we have two ways of receiving these alerts. So the first is via ZTF Team GCNs.

**(0:31 - 1:02)**
In that case, we as shifters or follow-up advocate, we have to add the candidates and the photometry on Skyportal. The second way to receive those alerts is via the theme broker on Skyportal main page. And in that case, a follow-up advocate, we have to update the tag from iCare or to not iCare or ask for follow-up if you think that the candidate is interesting and want follow-up.

**(1:03 - 1:29)**
The question is how to deal with these candidates and how to make the decision to trigger their network to perform follow-up observations. And the basic things to do is, in my opinion, to go on the fink web portal that you can access via this URL and type the ID of the alert. So that should look like ZTF23 and a bunch of letters that correspond to the unique ID of the transient.

**(1:30 - 2:01)**
It may appear that the alert is not available in Fink. For example, if the candidate has been added manually on Skyportal and it has not automatically been filtered by the classifier of Think. In that case, another way to have information on these candidates is to go on another ZTF broker, such as ALeRCE or Lasair, with those two web URLs.

**(2:05 - 2:34)**
The question is, as a follow-up advocate, to make a decision about whether or not the transient should be followed. It's particularly difficult when we have only one or two points of photometry. Which is the situation we most likely will have to face during a shift because the transient will be detected just after a gravitational wave transient.

**(2:34 - 2:56)**
And then we will have a very few points. So I'd like to propose some criterions to veto ZTF candidates proposed by Fink. So maybe the first natural thing to do is to cross-match the position of these alerts with the most recent gravitational wave alerts.

**(2:56 - 3:36)**
If none of the two, three previous gravitational wave alerts don't have the localization that includes some of these ZTF alerts, well, the alert is not worth following up. It's not a good candidate for being an electromagnetic counterpart. If it appears that a ZTF alert is coincident in space with a gravitational wave, then another thing to do is to go on the Fink web portal and check the classification.

**(3:36 - 4:04)**
If the candidate has been classified as something that's not a kilonova, such as a solar system object or supernovae, well, it's probably unrelated to the gravitational wave alerts and doesn't require any more follow-up. You may face the case where Fink classification is inconclusive. For example, if it's mixed between three or four different categories, or if it's classified as unknown by Think.

**(4:04 - 4:39):**
In that case, the alerts broker might help you for making a decision. Although we have to also keep in mind that grammar collaboration is closely related to the Fink collaboration, and that's not the case for the alerts one. If we have questions regarding the classification or the way the alerts are filtered by the alerts, it will be much more difficult to have information.

**(4:39 - 5:13)**
We should primarily refocus and keep our decision based on Fink information. Another good criterion to veto or not some ZTF candidates is to check when was the last detection. Beyond three to five days, that's probably not interesting anymore, in particular, if we're looking for kilonovae, because those kind of transient are expected to decay extremely rapidly with a rate of 0.3 to 0.5 magnitude per day, based on 170817.

**(5:14 - 5:48)**
After three to five days, especially considering the distance at which gravitational waves are detected, we won't be able to observe these transient with most of the grammar instruments. If no one else reported that it was a credible kilonovae candidate, it's probably not interesting anymore. A last criterion that could be easy to check is to look at the luminosity decay rate.

**(5:48 - 6:13)**
If it's below 0.3 magnitude per day, it's probably not a kilonovae. This decay rate is based on the gravitational wave detected in August 2017. Although this is not a hard limit, so it can be a bit above or a bit below these thresholds.

**(6:14 - 6:30)**
And we should be open-minded, because we don't have a lot of information about kilonovae diversity. And after all those criterions, I would like also to warn about what I just said. So these are basic rule of thumbs.

**(6:31 - 7:08)**
None of those criteria should be a hard stop, especially when we are looking at BNS gravitational wave candidates, because in that case, we expect electromagnetic emission. And we should be extra careful and look actually at the GCN from other collaborations. However, these returns should be easy to deal with most binary black hole merger cases, as we do not expect much electromagnetic counterpart in those events.

**(7:09 - 8:58)**
Although we should also not hesitate too much to ask for GRANDMA members help when some candidates are ambiguous, because we would be very sorry to miss some kilonovae, because we were not completely sure about what we were dealing with. Now that I have some of these representations, I'd like to give some examples that I actually had to deal with during my follow-up advocacy shift a few days ago. So like I said, on the Skyportal on I-care, you have here the gravitational alerts that are displayed.

And here on this panel, you have the ZTF kilonovae candidates provided by Fink. And I'd like to give two examples that actually happened during my shift. So these alerts, so ZTF23AANPZMV and ZTF23AANFWYW.

So those two alerts were recorded on Skyportal here for PZMV and WYW here. So they were classified as kilonovae candidates. So the first thing we have done is to go on the Skyportal web portal.

So this is the main page of the broker. And I typed here the ZTF ID, so these names here that are displayed on my tabs. After that, it get me to the Fink web portal page link related to these alerts.

**(8:59 - 9:44)**
So at the time of my shift for this alert, so WYW, I only had those points. And it was five days after the detection that we had to make the decision on whether or not to continue the follow-up. So based on that, my thoughts were that it was detected five days ago, so quite an old alert with only one detection.

If it was a kilonovae, GRANDMA would not be able to do much, especially with most instruments. And in addition, at that time, the Fink classification was not in favor of a kilonovae. It was more classified as unknown or either supernovae.

**(9:45 - 10:07)**
So based on those information, I decided to just go for a not ICARE. The second alert I had was sort of PZMV. And in that case, there were no information on Skype portal, on the Fink Skype portal, because it was this transient was added manually.

**(10:07 - 10:44)**
So it has no webpage because it has been classified with Fink. But at that time, I had to go on the ALERS ZTF Explorer broker and check for the classification provided by ALERS. And the classification was it was an asteroid.

So I decided, based on this information, to just not ICARE. I decided to type not ICARE on Skype portal. And yeah.

**(10:46 - 11:22)**
I also had a look on the other transient on ALeRCE, and it appeared that it was classified as a bogus in ALeRCE. And so it confirmed my classification of not ICARE for those two alerts. So I think it will be all for that video.

I'd like to thank you for listening, and I wish you were a good shift and a good O4 run.


## 7.12 Managing the Annotation and Adding Sources (Follow-up Advocate Training)

**(0:00 - 0:18)**
Hello everyone, I'll be talking about how to add sources to SkyPortal. More specifically, I'll talk about four different things and go through the process step by step. I'll talk about how to add the source to SkyPortal, how to add classifications such as tags on SkyPortal, like I care, not I care, go grandma, stop grandma, depending on the event.

**(0:19 - 0:33)**
Talk about how to add social comments and what type of social comments should be added. And then lastly, I'll talk about how to add photometry to ZTF candidates from different resources such as TNS. So I'll be sharing my screen and going through the process.

**(0:33 - 1:23)**
For example, for this gravitational wave event, S230627, there was a GCN circular released by ZTF that shows four different sources. To show how to add these sources on SkyPortal, I'll be using this specific source. Now, this GCN already shows a lot of different information about the source, including the right ascension, declination, etc.

However, this can also be added from something like TNS, which also included the same information about that same exact source. So to add this source, I'll be going to the main homepage of SkyPortal or I care, scrolling down and going to add a source, share the detail with grandma, and then copy the object ID, which is given by ZDF. The right ascension and the declination are given here in the same GCN.

**(1:23 - 1:40)**
So I'll copy this, paste it here, same thing for the declination, copy it, and paste, and then submit. And I'll find my source up here. I can click.

**(1:41 - 1:50)**
As this is an example, the source already has some work done to it. For example, some classification added or some social comments added. But now I'll show how to do these step by step.

**(1:51 - 2:04)**
After you've successfully added the source to SkyPortal and accessed it through sources, you can now open all the information about that source. Step two is classifying the source. Classification includes go grandma, stop grandma, I care, not I care, etc.

**(2:04 - 2:46)**
And this is extremely important as it shows everyone in grandma what exactly is happening with that source, as well as shows what telescopes teams should be doing with that source, whether you should observe or stop observation. To add a classification, all you need to do is scroll down to classifications. This is already classified as stop grandma and I care.

However, I'll show how to add a new classification. You go under add classifications, choose the group as grandma, and then choose the taxonomy as grandma campaign source observation 1.0. The classification can be go grandma, for example, and then a probability is one to show that it is go grandma. And then you submit.

**(2:49 - 3:05)**
Classification is saved and now you can see your name and that you've added that go grandma. Another type of classification is to again choose grandma as the group to share with, taxonomy as 1.2. And now you can classify it as I care or not I care. It's the same process.

**(3:06 - 3:49)**
You click on I care, put a probability of one and then submit. Similarly, if you are on the homepage of SkyPortal and you want to add or remove a tag to any of the events, for example, this latest event, you can simply click on the plus button. And then write down the tag.

So for example, I care. And then you will just need to reload SkyPortal and then you will see it here. I care to remove the tag.

You simply hover over it. You don't click, just stand over it with your cursor, hover over it with the cursor, go down to this bin and click on it. Delete tag, confirm.

**(3:51 - 4:06)**
Again, reload the page. And now it's gone. It's the same thing for all the other tags.

I can just hover over them and delete any of the tags. Now going back to the source page, showing is how to add social comments. Social comments again are very important.

**(4:06 - 10:22)**
They show exact details of what has been happening with this event, whether different telescopes have observed, whether the GCNs have been updated for that event, whether photometry has been added, etc. So to add a social comment, all you need to do is scroll down to comments. You go to add a comment.

You can see here all the other comments that people have added. You go to add a comment. For example, if you have just added photometry from TNS to this event and you want to report that in SkyPortal, then all you're going to write is photometry added from TNS or just to give an example, g-ZTF filter.

And then you go to TNS. This is where you would have added that photometry for the g-ZTF filter from. And then you copy that URL and then you paste that and then add the comment.

Now my comment will be added. Now these comments are extremely important and they're used to report everything that has been happening with that source. So to go through some of the comments here, for example, as this is a very good example of where the comments are important.

So you can see a report from the GCN circular about the photometric redshift. More information about the source. This is information about which teams have been able to observe or not observe.

So it says KAO team will not be able to observe the candidates. Another important piece of information that it was too faint for FFRAM and will not observe the candidate. And then lastly, someone saying that the candidate is no longer considered as a credible transient candidate as ZTF claimed a flat evolution.

So someone who has just opened that source can go through the comments, see exactly what happened, see which telescopes were able to observe, which ones were not able to observe and why. For example, it was too faint or they couldn't observe it because of the weather. And then lastly, a very important update here that it is no longer considered as a credible transient candidate.

So that if someone is still interested in that source, they can see that as GRANDMA, it has been regarded as not interesting or not credible anymore. As you go through sources on ICARE, you will see all the different gravitational wave source candidates and events. You can access any of them.

And then you can see all the classifications that have been happening with them, as well as all the comments from different telescope teams and their updates and why they have observed or not observed, as well as all the updates from different GCN circulars that have been released about this exact source. One more thing you can do on SkyPortal is to notify telescope teams to observe. All you need to do is click on the source and scroll down to follow up.

Then you can choose from the list of telescopes in collaboration with grandma, which telescope you think should observe. For example, here I'm choosing TAROT TCA. And then you can click on the desired observation, you can specify the exposure time, exposure counts, all the other details, and then you specify the start date and the end date of the observation.

What this does is that it notifies that specific telescope team to observe this specific source at that specific date and time. And once you scroll further down after submitting, you can also see all the other requests to all the other telescopes that people have done. Moreover, if you go to the dashboard on ICARE or the homepage and scroll down, you'll find a map with all the telescopes.

There's yellow and blue telescopes. The yellow ones are the ones in daytime currently, and the ones in blue are the ones in nighttime. This allows you to know which telescopes you can notify and which ones are within a good time to be able to observe that source.

It is best to notify telescope teams two hours before their nighttime to observe. The last thing I want to show is how to add photometry to these source candidates. So, taking another source, which is this one from the CMGCN circular, it has already been added onto Skyportal.

I'll scroll down to photometry, upload additional photometry, and I'll go to using the form. Now, to add the photometry, I'll be using the information from TNS about the specific source candidate. It shows here the photometry for the G and the R filters.

So, for the instrument for ZTF, it is put as CFH12KZTFGZTFIGZFR filters. You share the data with grandma. For the observation date, it is better to put it in MJD form.

So, either convert the normal date into MJD form, or if it's already provided in MJD form, then that is fine. I know here that I'll be doing this first one. So, GZTF, this first observation date.

So, I personally know that this observational date is going to be in this format in MJD. The magnitude, you can just copy the magnitude or flux given. The magnitude error, usually it could be given.

If it is not given, just as a placeholder, we will put 0.1. Limiting magnitude, again, could be given, could be not. If it is not given, again, as just a placeholder number, I will put 21.5. Magnitude system is AB, AB units. This is the filter in ZTFG.

If all the other information is also provided, you can also add that, and then you submit the photometry. I'll now also add the R filter photometry. If you reload the page of the source, that photometry will now load, and it is now added ZTF-g.

Again, I will upload additional photometry using the form. The instrument is the same. Share the data with grandma.

**(10:23 - 11:15)**
This is the observation date in MJD. My magnitude is found right here from the TNS server. The number is put because, unlike the rest of the information, the form will not be submitted without having a number in there.

Magnitude system is AB, and my filter is an R filter. I will now submit. If I go back to the page and reload the page, I will find both of the photometry uploaded.

That's it. I talked about how to add the source to SkyPortal, how to add tags and classification to that source, how to add social comments, as well as what type of social comments to expect on SkyPortal, and lastly, how to add photometry from different resources such as TNS. Thank you very much.


## 7.13 Sources candidates of GW - advices

**(00:00 Introduction)**
Hello everyone, I hope that you're doing fine. So today we are in April of 2024 and in this video I would like to make some update about the source candidates of GW and to give you more tips about it and to play with Skyportal for that. So right now I am on weekly coordinator with my team that name Flocon and so we have learned a lot discussing one to each other and in my team there are three people that are beginners so it's good to see what still need to be learned by the people.

So first I'd like to remember you that we are in O4B and there are different sources to track on. 

**(00:55 Sources for GRANDMA follow-up)**
So I have made a little panel for you. So first there is a gravitational wave alert and so you trigger GRANDMA if the source localization is below 200 degrees square or and this is the or of the sources is quite near so less than 200 megaparsec and so this is immediate so has the effect you don't ask question you just make go GROMAR you write an email and then you try to observe as much as you can with the galaxy targeting and so on and so forth.

The second type of source that we decided with Flocon is maybe there is a GRB sweep during our shift we will try to follow up we need also to have the detection of an optical so this is our criteria that we choose and why? Because we would like to get prepared for the some era when GRANDMA is a volunteering facility let's say so if we have time we can follow up the some alert. 

The third source is of course the kilonova when we try to expect that maybe there are some transients that look like kilonova and for that it is great to follow up so usually this message comes from the core team or maybe a GCN you see like maybe fast kilonova candidates so then you activate go GRANDMA. One, two, three and four and so the first one is that we call einstein probe x-ray sources so this is this wide field x-ray that just have been launched by the Chinese and some part of the European and and so for this kind of sources because we don't know how much will be the right what we expect in terms of optical counterparts the thing is that you need to reach Nicolas when you see something like this or the core team that will mandate you to create some follow up for the einstein probe and so to reach Nicolas you can use slack (@nleroy) and Leroy is his name so this is there so Leroy and then you ask him if this einstein probe candidate is reliable or not so you need to have the validation from Nicolas and the last one is of course our neutrino sources so you activate go GRANDMA only if you have a validation from TAP that already gives some kind of candidate in observation so you know which one you need to follow up or not.
It's not all the time yes so that's why you need to to contact so you meet either weekly coordinator either FAs.

**(03:48 Intro, S240422ed)**
 So now in this video I would like to tackle more with the event that we have so we have I mean this week S240422ED which was the first time that we have such a great candidate of GW quite well localized below 200 megaparsec but also 200 degrees square but also well localized 200 sorry distance quite close less than 200 megaparsec and so as I said so the team previously to me they performed some GW targeting and tiling so tiling with FRAM and galaxy targeting with different telescopes and so as I said me I am in the team Flocon okay and previously there was Cristina team and maybe this this gravitational wave then is an NSBH so just you you as a shifter you need to understand that sometime you start your shift with an event that have been already handled by the previous team and it's very important to make this kind of transition and so sometimes all the material is there and has been already prepared by the other team so it's not only just waiting for an alert it's also like continuously monitoring something that is done and so in this video we will look at this case sorry so we will look at this case which is a subs candidate because there have been some upgrade in terms of procedure and new tool and so I would like to show to you how my team handled that okay so imagine that you're in

**(05:35 GCNs)**
this situation right now there are some subs candidates that happen and then I will show you in my computer I mean all the things of of this event so that you can have a better understanding and some kind of upgrade of your skill for that all right okay so let's go okay so the thing that I have recorded this video before but my sound was not working so I am playing the video that was recorded before so just at the beginning I am looking I'm showing you that there have been a lot of GCN related to this gravitational wave events and you have so you have this which is LIGO Virgo but you have also a galaxy targeting a report so that you can observe with the galaxy you have x-ray information x-ray trigger report from the x-ray observatory and then but most of the of the circular are dominated by the optical facilities and so as a follow-up advocate is very it's very tough in fact you to to organize all of that so now

**(06:57 GCN S24022ed)**
 I'm going to Skyportal also because what I would like to show you is like as an FA you need to to in fact comment all the circular in interaction like I mean Yodgor and Priya they have done so it's not necessary to copy paste everything this is not a good report this is okay but not a good report it's better to do like like Marion just a very summary of what happened if it is useful or not and there will be some candidates that we will register in Skyportal some candidates that will register in Skyportal and trigger some telescope in GRANDMA other registered Skyportal triggers a full network and others that we don't do anything and we just comment in in here so what I like to show you is also to go to properties because here down if you go down you can update and have in fact only the selection of the circular per a GCN event which is something that I really like to do.

**(08:20 Counterpart candidate, intro)**
okay so back in on the circular table let's find something that they detect someone that report a detection that we will need to upload in Skyportal so I am finding a nice one like the Einstein probe candidate of GWAP240426 so we will look what is important so it's an X-ray candidate it's not optical so the idea is to detect the optical counterpart this is the coordinate that we will report in Skyportal we also give comments to the date we would like to understand if it is not too old compared to the gravitational wave event and so now coming back to Skyportal I will show you how to in fact create a source.

**(09:11 Add counterpart)**
 so what is very important is this is this GRANDMA tag because otherwise people do not have access to your source and then you put your coordinate in it so you come back to the circular and you give your RA/DEC yeah this name for example and then the RA/DEC that we just we just discussed about it so you see for example that this in fact event have been already registered by some member of my team and now you can see the report so imagine that you're the first one that upgrade this upload this Skyportal event

 so you have created the sources and then you need to to copy paste the circular oops I'm having too many pages like everyone and say that it is a new candidate let's say what about it it's an X-ray right and maybe the delay time so it's not four years old maybe it's four days old right 

um to give a bit some information because everything that is stored in Slack will be removed so it is important to to have the things and because it is a Einstein probe also we can ask Nicolas if he thinks that this is useful or not if it is a real trigger from the Einstein probe point of view and then if it is associated to to gravitational wave for for this one it is very important to validate by Nicolas about this thing the thing that it is real or not so the next step is when you have created this sources if this source is observable by GRANDMA and which telescopes 

and so I just saw that you need to click on observability and you will get this kind of pdf when you see clearly which telescopes so this is one you can observe and so you can see in this list that all the telescopes are in from the south 

so it's a good news for us because we can the idea that we will do is to look at atlas and to look back on archival data so now coming back to Skyportal yeah so what we're gonna do 

**(11:43 Force photometry ATLAS)**
right now is that we're gonna perform force photometry with atlas the idea is that if atlas have found an optical counterpart before the x-ray time if it is true it means that it was not I mean a new transient 

so I show you force photometry then you select atlas you give start and stop so usually what is good is to give six days before so be careful because by default it is one month before so it is a lot of data okay so I'm zooming so that you can show and so I will put like just seven days before I think yes and then you click submit and if you click submit you will have requests so oops you can also do it for ztf is the sources from the north 

but so here yeah I mess up so I will go down and just check so this is the atlas request and what you have filling in is this request so they have been done by me by also Michael and you can see that there is a one year search and a six a six day search so that's why the time is 250 in days because in fact we try to look back on all possible data points last year from today since the last year 

okay so now I will remove to show you because normally there is nothing I'll show you that atlas atlas oh which means the orange filter of atlas has some detection 100 days before so maybe there are some kind of sources that have some activity around also these sources is is very close to a galaxy so maybe there are some activity in the galaxy so this is something that you need to discuss with your weekly coordinator it needs to discuss with his team so the triangle or the upper limit and rounded or the detection around the circle or the detection okay so now let me recap what we

**(14:15 Advices 1)**
have just seen in my computer so it was an Einstein probe 240426 associated to gravitational wave alert and so it is some kind of interesting not exceptional it's not clear if it is associated to the gravitational wave so it's not worth to put a GO GRANDMA we need to investigate further or we need to trigger some of the telescopes so the process is first I have noted register into sniper tool and please notify group GRANDMA number one

 number two run ATLAS photometry so search for any detection before from now to the last the last six days or for a year what have done the search for your help to determine if there was some detection are they valid or not this is a question that we can investigate 

then number three check the observability map to check which telescopes of GRANDMA can observe and they are like me and my team we have seen that maybe because we received this this new transient in the morning so to focus on people in the south and for the morning in so to trigger KNC because they have access to australia telescopes to trigger LEMAC because it's a la reunion and then we can have data on this source within the next six hours and for example FRAM it's a bit it's would be a good telescope but it's like 12 hours from now so maybe we will trigger only after so this is something that you need to discuss with your team is not only either activate go GRANDMA or just activate or not activate is about the different is about like being smart and discuss with your weekly coordinator 

and if you don't know by by name by memory your telescopes you need to interact with the weekly coordinator with the core team so this is where we are so it's a bit small but we have register into skyportal okay the sources then run atlas photometry if there is or i put atlas class or the tf if it is in the north but it's like this oops yeah okay north then check the observability map of GRANDMA for me for this source is like this i have to do it like this oh my god okay

 i have activated on KNC and LEMAC and now then trigger some telescopes i said uh and no need to because it's not only everyone no need to say something in observation or you can say just like you have triggered some of the telescopes and then the last step so one two three four five the last step is that your weekly coordinator uh so you that watch the video weekly coordinator you need to get prepared to create the OwnCloud repository if it is can say to contact Damien or Jean-Gregoire or Pierre-Alexandre or me to activate KNC and to have the data and so this is what i wrote down weekly coordinator so this is a task for the weekly coordinator so now the next step is to record while you

**(18:03 Reporting GCNs)**
have triggering GRANDMA you're waiting for observation you're doing the analysis you need also to report in skyportal what the other have done and this is something that is extremely useful and so in gravitational way there are multiple reporting from different sources at the same time and this is why it is confusing but need a lot of rigor and i believe that you can do it so 

okay so now let's see that we focus on this event yeah and we will look at the different report made by other teams in GRANDMA okay so if i'm writing down like this you have all the report from people and we can look at this so they report some kind of upper limit 

so it's not a detection it's an upper limit so you come back to your skyportal page okay and you need to report that they have been uh i mean some i mean on online right when when the gcn appear you need to report that you have uh i mean i've seen this circular and you open it you see the time you see that it's an upper limit and so now let's upload the photometry and you need to do that for all 

**(19:41 Upload photometry)**
 the sources it's very important use the form select the instrument so if it is gcn just select generic generic generic
 if it is a GRANDMA one you need to select the things just select GRANDMA please you can keep it on there and then we have a problem because here it is mentioned with this name and so it is confusing for you so uh yeah if you do that it won't be good so i prefer that you use yeah that you're converting into mjd so that there is no issue in terms of format so i use the extant app from the nether i just convert it you have the conversion into mjd and this is mjd and this is what you're gonna put here so that is always work then don't put anything in magnitude maintain error because there is nothing

 and then oops 18.7 it is in sloan so it is ab origin so  i think what is good is to put the name of the telescopes i put gcn but i think it's better to put the name of the telescopes and the filter yeah yeah i yes and then click on submit photometry

 so now i am on my source i go to the photometric symbol and you will see that it has been upgraded so here i just reordered in time the table and because it was a previous observation we have it look it is me and there is magnitude limit so it is all fine and so you're really coming in turn trying to say that it's validate or not okay because i forgot so you click on valid yes good and so you see that in my report i have as a weekly coordinator pointer so it's a weekly coordinator i need to double check there is something that i did not say yes because you can see here that there have been some detection whereas it was not it was not true so be careful because sometimes you as fa you make mistake and so the mistake stay.

**(22:24 Advices 2)**
 okay so it is me again so what we have seen the state that we have covered here together okay the step that we have covered together is uh reporting photometry uh from sources and upper limits is uh validation from the weekly coordinator uh and so to use you need to use the web form and also you need to comment at every time that you upload something in sky portal in term of photometry this is very important these things because it's not necessarily done and then we have keep track we lost track on things okay so reporting photometry that are not in GRANDMA validation things made by the weekly coordinator and web form okay so now it's time.

**(23:15 Stdpipeweb (a bit))**
to look now at our data because remember that for this loop we have also data from GRANDMA because we have succeeded to trigger the adequate telescope for that and we will take as an example the data that we have obtained from lemac because remember we ask lemac to to follow up so let's do that now 

and i will show you uh how to analyze that there is a long documentation made by the DAG i am happy if you can read it and uh and upgrade i won't do that in the in the in this video just very quick to show what mistake have been done but really you need to look at this documentation all right

 okay so i am now navigating in you see the alerts the image the stack and so lemac has performed as uploading some data regarding ep this is this is named here so now i will run this analysis for ep so i go to uh i go to gw so of course if you don't have access to this website you can ask me  i will ask you again or you can ask directly so you go to image stack and then lemac the thing that i wanted that we observe

so you wait like this sometimes it takes long because there are many people at the website at the same time and process is tired so because it is you see this is the sources and so we need to we need to i mean focus on the localization of the source that's why i am picking up this information here so i take it here so sometimes you forget to to do it right so you need to do it because we want to find the source here i like to make a custom mask why because sometimes in the border of the image there is some black pixel so up tag 

sorry you hear skype a slack because there are some people from my team that asking me things 

okay inspecting sometimes it takes ever but yeah this is this is the goal and uh so what you need to remember is this game that is set up to one because in fact in the header of the face file we don't have the information and the saturation level sometimes your image will not work and you need to modify these two things gain and saturation level so we are in e 

so then you see the the filter was not recognized it's in the south so we can take skymapper maybe we will try panstar or gaia gaia always work but it's mostly for johnson uh cousin filters 

so i just select i and let's see what is done so it takes some time so i will make pause and see you there when it is done

 yeah i forgot to tell you that you you can look at this uh limiting mag for example sometimes there is no few sources you can modify these things which uh will help you or modify the reference catalog it will change a thing okay so we have the result what you see already is that this is instrumental model it should be like less than one normally so you see that after 18 is kind of bad 

here is excel so we don't have but we still have some point here that was not great you know and the most problematic it is color time of 0.5 which means that the star photometry of the star that we know they are not matched in fact the catalogs reference which is not good so maybe um the telescopes did not observe in i maybe um the filter is not well settled or maybe it's just because of some environmental effects or there's something
 weird so what i suggest you is to uh change the catalogs i'm also checking this but i mean you can ask like so much it's 0.4 so it's nice and you can see the upper limits 

so if you see some dispersion here it means that the image was not in good quality maybe the stacking was not done greatly um and so here is i mean at the location that you indicated you can see that in the template there are the galaxy so if we detect a sources i mean maybe it's in the hollow of the galaxy so which means that not necessarily will be detected some people

click one subscription because they like to click click click click but i told you not to do that because it's really for export and so then what i would like to see is what you are happy with your result then you're gonna upload it into sky portal 

and i have run another simulation use error mag for example and you see that the color 10.13 is much better so that's why you don't need to click click click on a std pipe but you need to train with the DAG and you need to add some with the DAG otherwise it will be a mess

 so now i am selecting the task for which i am happy and i'm going to send it to sky portal i'm selecting lemac if it is an instrument that is not in this list you need to put generic and then the photometric will be uploaded so here we don't have um the things because my own register knows the source that is exactly at the same location but it's it's okay right if it works definitely and go to the to the page okay so let 

**(29:43 Advices 3)**
me recap what we've seen for the data analysis on std pipe web so i have put for you that if it's not worked maybe you need to check again the saturation the mask the filter the reference and the catalog limiting magnitude. These are the key parameters. 

 if all this does not work this is by my kids but if all doesn't me just ask DAG 

**(30:10 Writing circulars)**
just ask Sergey just ask PA there there to help you and very happy so you are not alone but just try to to do something right

 so we will go to the next challenge which is the writing the the circular because I would like to give more instruction about that because I think there needs to be some mentoring and for so for um our event right we have uh made some circular for uh Galaxy targeting for tiling and for source candidate so you have the three example in hand I will just show it now 

okay so stay tuned I know it is long but I hope it will give you a lot of more information okay so let's go to the different Circulars so we will first go with uh the Einstein one so the source candidate first please make sure as a weekly an you put the good title so it start with the things not only this or I don't know what then you need to put Grandma one uh you need to put Optical upper limit or detection you need to put the source candidate then you will yeah upperlimits limits I said detection of uppser limits and then you will add all the all the shifters the core team uh The Observers and people that help for example for the data analysis like Jean-Gregoire

 and then you will give uh some kind of information um about Atlas about the photometry so you grab it from skyportal be careful that sometime you need to put in AB system or in a Vega system you need to put the calibration then change like in skyportal it is AB system here in Johnson and then the time from skyportal the delay compared to t0 that you must Define sometime in days sometime in hours the result of the data analysis if you find a sources and so on and then the section to GRANDMA

 so now I go to the second type of the circular which is signing circular things of a gravitational wave again the list of shifter the core team the Observer and the number of time that people have done but very important uh yeah with the with the magnitude also the the probability to be recovered and very important the data analysis right don't send something if the data analysis is not done like if we didn't detect anything we said we did not detect any transient at this magnitude 

and the last one is uh is about the Galaxy targeting stuff so it is similarly the same things and with um with also uh things but you I mean there also detection if we detect on the number of galaxies for each uh observation um I mean an example of each Galaxy so you can Jean-Gregoire ask to help you a result of the analysis also reference very important we have done that if the source was observe or I mean we have the same the others also if we have observed some kind of I mean in this circular were also source candidate thank you and this is it

**(33:59 Conclusions)**
 okay so thank you to have you sent to me so I just have a final conclusion um so to have a success of your team you really need um and and in fact you as an FA so with your team you need to communication to communicate this is uh very important because you need to communicate between your team is not only saying yeah uh on duty off Duty is really to help one to each other this is a chance to upgrade your skills

 uh to perform greater training and the weekly conator give you a training for example me spend three hours before uh I mean to start to explain and when this event happen there was something that was not well understood and each of you um I mean fa or weekly coordinator need to be engaged and responsible you are the one in fact that um that are responsible of the full Network you know and we we rely on it so it's very important to do that okay and uh yeah don't forget to drink of course with your grandmother so nice to be healthy for your shifter okay so see you because we are only Saturday and we still need to I mean manage this candidate okay au revoir bye-bye have a nice time


## 7.14 Responding to Gravitational Wave Alerts: Follow-Up Advocate

**(Introduction)**

Hello, for those who do not know me. I am Cristina Andrade, a GRANDMA core team member. 
In this video, I’ll cover how to read and respond to the various types of Gravitational-Wave alerts. 
I’ll break down the process into manageable sections and provide detailed instructions for each step. 
Feel free to send your questions to the zoom chat or the #training channel. An experienced team member can respond in the interim or I will respond at the break between sections. 

**(Section 1: Getting Started)**

Please make sure you are signed up for Owncloud, SkyPortal and FORGE. You can find the information on connecting in the manual under Section 1 “Signing Up for GRANDMA’s Utilities”

I am going to briefly go over the correct settings you should see in order to be receiving alerts from SkyPortal. 

We will use SkyPortal in our observational campaigns. This platform serves as our interface for conducting the campaign, including receiving alerts, contacting teams, updating data, etc.

Upon connecting, you'll encounter a page similar to the one shown below (if not, click on Dashboard in the left sidebar). Your initials should appear in the top right corner.

To correctly set up your profile in SkyPortal, you need to adjust your profile settings to activate the notifications you wish to receive.

 As Follow-Up Advocates (FAs), you'll need to access your profile to modify your notification preferences.

For Follow-Up Advocates:

When making any setting changes, press update after each line.

Make sure you have turned on the "Sources" button and select GW CANDIDATE and GW COUNTERPART from the list of options.

Click Update!

Below "sources," find the "GCN Events" option. Ensure to activate this option and then click "create new profile."

Your GCN Events profile should include: LVC_PRELIMINARY, LVC_INITIAL, LVC_UPDATE, LVC_RETRACTION under "GCN Notice Types" and GW under "GCN Tags," as shown below:

Make sure to press update. 

In all cases, make sure to configure options to receive alerts via email and Slack by clicking on the "bell" symbol.

Make sure to select on shift as this will guarantee notifications while you have signed up as a shifter. 

For information on how to turn these settings on in Skyportal, you can go to the manual under Section 1.5, “Connecting to ICARE Skyportal” or find this video in the GRANDMA youtube channel. 

For Slack notification instructions, check under Section 1.2 or just google “how to turn on notifications for specific slack channels”.

I will pause here for questions. The next section will discuss how to understand the different GW alert types. 

**(Section 2: Understanding GW Alert Types)**

While you are on shift, you are going to be checking the status of the #gwalerts channel on slack often.
I recommend once every ~15 minutes to ensure prompt response. 
As soon as a new GW trigger is received, the #gwalerts channel will have a new entry. At the time of an alert, you will receive an email AS SHOWN ON THE LEFT or see a message in the #gwalerts channel as shown on the right. Read the entry. 
You are going to see one of four different types of alerts: early, preliminary, initial, and update.
The first you’ll receive for a new detection is a PRELIMINARY alert. 
In GRANDMA, we initially respond to the PRELIMINARY alert. This is the first type of alert you will receive when an event is detected by LVK (LIGO - VIRGO - KAGRA).  
PRELIMINARY alerts have a SKYMAP associated with it. This is what GRANDMA uses to point our telescopes.
You can find this skymap and other relevant information pertaining to the alert by clicking on the link found in the #gwalerts channel. This will take you to the gracedb.ligo.org page for this detection. 
Here you can see what the time of the alert was. If you scroll down to “Log Messages”, you can find the PRELIMINARY sky map. This sky map was released alongside the first preliminary alert. 
The gravitational-wave experts at LVK also receive the PRELIMINARY alert and they are woken up to understand whether or not it comes from an astrophysical event or it is just noise. 
I’ll talk more about noise later. 
The PRELIMINARY alert arrives when LVK interferometers have made a detection and the systems on LVK are processing the information. 
The INITIAL alert is the next type of alert to arrive after the PRELIMINARY. 
Initial:
INITIAL alerts can arrive within an hour of the preliminary to several hours later. Sometimes, an INITIAL alert  is not sent to the community or is never received by GRANDMA. 
As well, in the event that the alert is not astrophysical (a false alert), you will receive a retraction.
The next type of alert to arrive after the INITIAL is the UPDATE. 
Update:
After several hours to one day, we receive an UPDATE alert for the same event. 
The INITIAL and UPDATE alert are important to monitor because it will constrict the skymap of the GW source. 
Only some events will have a PRELIMINARY, INITIAL AND UPDATE alerts. Not all of the
events will. 
As a shifter, you need to read all of the alerts that arrive during your shift, whether you have received the PRELIMINARY alerts during your shift time or not. This is why it is important to make accurate reports between shift times."
SIDE NOTE:  "Rarely, before the PRELIMINARY, an EARLY warning alert will be delivered. We do not follow up in GRANDMA with these EARLY alerts because there is no skymap associated with it. These are not things you need to respond to. Wait for the PRELIMINARY alert. ”
Sarah describes the different alert types in more detail in her video “GW alert: different types”. The transcript for this video can be found in Section 7.8 of the manual. 
Now, we know what the various types of alerts we can receive during our shift time will look like. 

I will pause here for questions. The next section will go over what to do when we receive a new preliminary alert. 

**(Section 3: We received a new PRELIMINARY alert!)**

When you receive a new PRELIMINARY alert, Check the properties of the alert in the @gwalerts channel. Then, write a report in the #observations channel; specifying the type and quality of the alert. 
This will allow the wider collaboration to be notified of an event and prepare. 
This report will include the following: 
What is the name of the alert? 
Is it a BBH,BHNS, BNS? 
What is its Distance? 
What is the area?
Do we Follow - Up? 
And if we do follow-up, or “GO-GRANDMA”, we need to tag the whole channel. “@channel” 

When reading a preliminary alert, we need to understand its quality in order to correctly respond to the “Follow-Up?” question. 

 GRANDMA focuses on alerts originating from BNS and BHNS, located relatively nearby—below 200 Mpc—and within an area below 200 deg^2, with a GRANDMA score of 2 or 3. These are the properties you will primarily look at to determine follow-up. 

SIDE NOTE: There are two other properties to keep in mind when determining follow-up for detections that may not score high but have other good properties.
Check Trigger Time and Time since T0 in the #gwalerts message. If "Time since T0” is above one day, it means that we don't care about it. 

The second, Coherence between detectors vs noise, we need to see the value. When it is below negative three, it means that there is a high chance that the event is not astrophysical and is a mistake or just noise. 

These are the secondary properties you will weigh when the distance, area and GRANDMA score are not in perfect conditions. 

 If all the primary requirements are met, you can request follow-up observation by submitting the report and including “GO-GRANDMA” in the message you send to #observations. 

This means you are notifying telescopes to begin observing.

If the alert does not meet these criteria, you respond with NO FOLLOW UP.

When this tag happens, no email needs to be sent and no mention in skyportal.

These are example reports for alerts of different types and significance: 
Example 1 is a good alert:
New GW alert: S230525a, NSBH, Distance: 276.0 +/- 79.0 Mpc, GRANDMA Score: 2, GO-GRANDMA. @channel
Example 2 is an alert that is not of interest to GRANDMA: 
New GW Alert: S231231ag, BBH, distance 1114 +/- 357 Mpc, no follow up.
Example 3 occurs after you receive an initial alert or an update that clarifies it is no longer worth following up on. For example, it is no longer a BNS or NSBH. 
No new observations. Tagged alert GW230525 with “BBH” and “Not I-care”. Removed “GO-GRANDMA”. 

You include this information in your end of shift report. I will discuss end of shift reports in more detail at a later time but they are similar to what you send in observations. 

Make note that sometimes new PRELIMINARY alerts can come in between UPDATE or INITIAL alerts for another detection. It is possible that you will be managing several different alerts at the same time.

Sarah describes this in more detail in her video, “Preliminary alert slack message”. This video should have already been viewed by the FAs, as she discusses important nuances that help FAs determine follow-up. 

The transcripts for that video are in Section 8.3. A summary of that information is also found in the manual under Section 3.

I will pause here for questions. The next section will go over what to do after you post in the #observations channel. 

**(Section 4: “GO GRANDMA”)**

If it is a good quality alert and you have sent out requests for follow-up observations, these are your next steps. 

 Add the name of the event, for example, “S231231ag” in Skyportal, by accessing the menu bar and going to ‘Sources’. This is not automatically done. 

 Make sure it is tagged “I-care” and “GO  GRANDMA”  by selecting  the "+" symbol on the Skyportal interface. This informs anyone viewing Skyportal that we are currently observing this detection. 

To note, after a follow-up worthy PRELIMINARY alert is sent out, GRANDMA will automatically generate an observation plan. 
Telescope teams will be able to retrieve these plans from owncloud or Skyportal.
 
As telescope teams respond to you in #observations, enter who is and is not observing and why, in the comments section of SkyPortal; include the telescope name, who responded to you, and if they cannot observe…include why. 

SIDE NOTE:  The telescope teams must conduct observations within 24 hours of receiving the plan. If they do not, no further observations are required.

So, make sure to accurately update Skyportal from information in #observations and when posting to the comment section on skyportal.

Update the event accordingly as you receive more alerts about the object: 

 If the source does not meet follow up specifications, you can remove the tag “GO GRANDMA” and add the tag "Not I-care". You can remove tags by hovering over them and selecting the trash symbol. 

To sum it up, IF it is follow up worthy, you tag “I-care” and “GO GRANDMA”. 

If it does not, remove GO GRANDMA and add “Not I-care”. 

Furthermore and the last step, if you have initiated observations, upon confirmation from the core team that we are stopping all observations, remove the “GO GRANDMA" tag and add "STOP GRANDMA" with the +. Make a short announcement in #observations and include it in your end of shift report.  

I will pause here for questions. The next section will go over what to do after you’ve requested observations and the subject of GW counterpart candidates. 

Section 5: Responding to New GW Counterpart Candidates from GCN Circulars

So far, we have reviewed the different types of alerts, what makes a detection worth following up on, how to request observations, and learned where to document which telescopes have confirmed their ability to observe. 

Now, we will discuss what the protocol is in the case that we get to observe a GW counterpart candidate.

Due to this process of observation following a PRELIMINARY alert that we previously discussed, potential candidates for the optical counterpart can be identified. These are what we refer to as GW source candidates. 

We have a 72-hour window which needs to begin in the first 24 hours following the PRELIMINARY alert. Then, we can search for GW source candidates within the subsequent 72 hours for both types of observation plans (including Galaxy targeting and tiling).

As telescope teams are observing and uploading images of the GW source candidates, FA’s will be doing the following. These will be expanded on in another video and in the manual soon:

 linking significant GW alerts with Skyportal and adding corresponding sources by checking GCN circulars that you should be receiving in your email, TNS and Fink for additional data. 

You’ll be adding photometry data from GCN circulars as they are uploaded to owncloud.

For sources not belonging to significant GW alerts, notify admins to add corresponding GCN events in #icare-skyportal channel.

You’ll be assessing observability in SkyPortal and contacting relevant telescope teams. 
Annotating reports in SkyPortal for 3 days.

Ensuring Science READY images and photometry values are updated.

For more information on GW Source Candidates and different types of observation plans, please refer to Sarah’s video, “GW source candidates - Transients (follow-up advocate)”. As well, the transcript for this video can be found in Section 7.7. 

Next Section is End of Shift Reports and what they look like. 

**(Section 6: End of Shift Report)**
The end of shift reports are pretty straight forward and do not need to follow an exact format. Examples of a template with a list of telescopes do exist in the manual under Section 4.1, in case you ever need a reminder. 
However, end of shift reports do need to include the following, if applicable: name of new alert that occurred during your shift, updates for any previous alerts that were followed up on, telescope teams you contacted, the most recent GCN circulars that occurred during your shift, and any activities in skyportal (such as did you update any tables, comments, candidates, or GCNs on skyportal).
NOTE: If any of these are not applicable to what occurred during your shift time. For example, if there were no new alerts, state “No new alerts.” 
Like I stated before, they should look like what you send in #observations for an alert. 
These are example reports for alerts of different types and significance: 
Example 1 is a good alert:
New GW alert: S230525a, NSBH, GRANDMA Score: 2, GO-GRANDMA, waiting for responses from telescope teams. The following telescopes have responded: XX, YY, ZZ. Created skyportal source for it. Comments have been updated. 
Example 2 
1 New GW Alert: S231231ag, BBH, distance 1114 +/- 357 Mpc, no follow up.
Example 3 
No new alerts, Last GCN #####, updated skyportal comments for S230525a. Checked photometry for {insert telescope here}.

**(Conclusion)**

As we conclude this video, remember to follow these steps diligently for effective follow-up actions. 
As well, during your shift, make sure to read all alerts in the #gwalerts channel as it is possible for parameters to change and a detection to become worthy or unworthy of follow up. 
If you have any questions or encounter difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. 
Thank you for your attention, and let's continue our efforts to contribute meaningfully to our observations in O4b.
