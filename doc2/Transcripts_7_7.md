### 7.7 GW source candidates - Transients (follow-up advocate)

**(00:00 Introduction)**
 Hello everyone, so now I would like to give the training, so this is for the follow-up advocates, part 3, and we're going to talk about the source candidates.

**(00:15 Source GW candidate : what is it ?)**
So, the source candidates, counterpart candidates, is what I call the source candidates. It comes after when there is a gravitational wave alert.

 First, you have message preliminary that happens within minutes, so after a gravitational wave is detected, you have the message within minutes. Then, remember that GRANDMA will automatically provide an observation plan, either with tiling, either with galaxy targeting, that will happen from 10 to 40 minutes after the first message, and the team needs to observe this within 24 hours. After that, there is no need to observe.

But because of this search, there will be some candidates within the counterpart that will be found, either by GRANDMA, either by other team, and this is what we call GW source candidates, so either by other team, either by GRANDMA, and we ask the telescope team of GRANDMA to observe them within 72 hours. 

So this is two types of observation, or even three types, galaxy tilings within 24 hours, and then gravitational source candidates within 72 hours. So this step, what is this step? It's just to find if among these source candidates, there is the counterpart of the gravitational wave alert, and we just follow this one.

 But for that, we need to observe them to see how it will fade, to see if this source candidate is the gravitational wave counterpart, or finally, it's just something like that. Remember, we have done that already with FINK during the training. Remember, FINK paper, and etc, etc.

So, these source candidates, just to recap, if someone is lost. So we have the 90% credible region provided by LIGO VIRGO. Then we're going to pave it, or we're going to check some interesting galaxies, and then this first step leads to some source candidates that we will follow, which means that all the telescopes of GRANDMA cannot observe all these sources.

The number of sources can vary, like from 1, from 0, to 20, let's say, 20, 50. It depends from different teams, so it's not only GRANDMA, in the others. And sometimes during the follow-up, we see that it's not the gravitational wave counterpart.



**(03:15 Select the source candidate )**
 or other teams say, oh no, it's not the gravitational wave counterpart, and so we need to stop observation also in GRANDMA.
.
So, how do you know that it is interesting? Why GRANDMA will follow this gravitational wave counterpart? So I'm just here, okay? Gravitational wave counterpart. Okay, so why do we need that it is interesting? So, we will read the GCN, maybe in the message sent by other teams, they say, yeah, it's so nice, it's so interesting, maybe it's sure, there is high probability that this is the counterpart. So serious, go, go, go, go, go, GRANDMA.

Sometimes in the message provided by the other team, it is, yeah, maybe this is just, but we don't know, we don't know the color, yeah, this is okay, we just send one or two telescopes of GRANDMA. 

Also, if you would like to say, do I ask GRANDMA to follow up these source candidates or not, you need to tell how many sources we are already observing GRANDMA. If we have already five sources and this source is not very interesting, it's not worth to trigger GRANDMA.

And then, ask, if you are lost, ask your weekly coordinator, like always, that will tell you what to do.

**(04:29 Timeline)**
 So I just like put in this paper the timeline, just to be sure that you have understood. So imagine that, oh no, this is not this one, imagine that we are at this alert, so remember GW is not starting with GW, it's starting with S, this is the 3rd, June 26th, 23rd, so imagine that we are in that situation, there is a gravitational wave alert coming.

The first source, for example, receives a gravitational wave alert. So it receives it and it receives a plan, it decides to follow up or not. Then the follow up advocate number 2, so for example it is you, you won't just like choose wait, oh, I'm waiting another alert, remember? You will maybe send the plan of Galaxy tiling for telescope that were during daytime, during that time, but need to observe something.

So this is you that decide whether or not they will observe it, regarding how it goes, if the source is very interesting or not. Then we have FA number 3, so because they have been already starting observation down, I mean, since 12 hours, you know, because from the FA1 to FA3 there is 12 hours, maybe there is some candidate proposed by GRANDMA or external. To be honest, we are trying to provide candidate from GRANDMA, but usually we can't, so we just follow up candidate from the external community.
But this is a secret, okay? So remember that, so imagine that there is a team that say, yeah, I have a source candidate from GW. So this comes from FA3, but still from this alert. So you need to do something.
And then FA number 4, you receive, you also look at the GCN, so the report from other team. And he saw that there is another interesting alert, so he will deal with this source candidate. But FA3 can also maybe, FA4 can also look at this candidate number 1. So this is really a team, okay? You just need not to wait, and yeah, you need to contact people.
And maybe FA number 4 will see that finally soure candidate number 1 is not any more interesting to follow up, so he needs to stop things within GRANDMA.

**(06:52 Summary)**
 So now just as a recap recap, because I like to make recap for you. I just need my paper.
So now I will show in the computer how to do this different step. I mean, see what the other team are doing, or GRANDMA. Register the source from Skyportal.

Whether or not we're going to follow up with GRANDMA. How to stop observation in GRANDMA. And check the photometry.

**(07:21 GCN)**
Okay, so let's go now. So now, so first, remember in my just presentation, we go to nasa.gcn.gov. You have this page. So you need to first sign in.

I don't show how to sign in. Everyone knows how to sign in to a website. And for example, me, I go, you go then to profile, email notification, I think.

And I turn off, so it was off. I turn off and turn on circular. Okay, so this is the thing that you need to do.

So that you will receive by email all the message from NASA, GCN NASA. And in GCN NASA, you will receive this kind of image. 

**(08:09 GCN Circulars)**
You see, so maybe I go. Okay, I go. So the last message that was sent to all the list was Fermi Gamma Ray Burst Monitor Trigger. Okay, nothing related with GW.

So last, last one, GRB. Okay, nothing related to GW. Another different alert. No, not GW. Ah, LIGO Virgo. Yeah, GW.
S230522N, Global Master Net Observation. So usually, we don't care about master. So we don't take care.

And then there is this one associated to this alert. So you see, master was associated to 0522N. And here, it is associated to 18H.

So for example, I am the shifter. I look at this GCN. So you see, blah, blah, blah, blah. So he said that SWIFT observation candidates began 73 hours. So you see, it's very old. But no matter what, we're going to try to say, imagine that it's very interesting.

We're going to try to record this target. No, it's not very interesting because we don't have the coordinates. So I will find another example nicer.

**(09:31 Add a source in skyportal)**
So this one. So we look at 21K. Okay. And he proposed two candidates. And these are the coordinates. Okay.

So I go to ICARE. And I go down. We see add source. Grandma. Yeah. Object.

So object is this one, we said. So I took that name. If there is two names, you just select your favorite one. Okay. So. Okay.

So then you tell me, right ascension, declination. So right ascension. Oh. Oh. Declination. 

Submit. I submit. So save. So usually I advise you to always reload a bit the page.
So we are happy because there is a new source. It's my source that I have added.

**(10:49 Add photometry from the GCN)**
If you would like, because we see the photometry. So the photometry is 15.56J. You can go to this page. No, sorry. To that page.

Because here we just create the coordinate. And we can upload photometry via the form. Here you will select Grandma.

Observation that the one that were said. So sometimes they don't say it. But yeah. Maybe this one. If it is, it needs to be in UTC. So you need to convert it. I don't do it now. What is important is to have the origin. Sorry.

The instrument you click on generic. Okay. Because generic is a GCN. Generic GCN. Okay. And then when the form is done, you click to submit.
So this is what you need to do. 

**(11:52 Comment and ask observations)**
And then to ask a telescope's team to observe. So it's like, hi, I have created this source.

And you can put here the subject. So that we know where it comes from, etc., etc. So once again. And the number. Okay. Ah.

And then this is ICARE, yeah. And if it's really interesting, you can wake up everyone by saying, Go Grandma, probability one. And then if I go back to dashboard, you see my source.
And go Grandma.

**(12:57 Stop observations)**
If, for example, you're on the next shifter and you show in the circular, someone saying, no, finally, it's not very interesting. Or it is like today that we have no feedback from no one.
You select Stop Grandma. And you go there. And you say.

Or you can say, or I can say. Toto, this is a name. Lily, can you confirm with TCA that, so it's a telescope that they will observe.

No? Or TCA told me that they have uploaded the image. You know, this kind of stuff.

**(14:34 Send an observation plan to one telescope)**
 If you want to send only an observation plan for someone, or someone from the team would like to send it to themselves, you can, for example, I select TAO.

Grandma, okay, PS1, super, perfect. I want to observe it today. And for tomorrow. And I click Submit. Okay. And when I go to, which one am I? You see, I have a plan submitted.

Usually there is this thing, so it's a bug, don't worry, but it is submitted. And so what does it mean? So this person, I mean, you select TAO, so TAO is me. 

So if I go back to my email, you see, because it was Go Grandma, I received a first email to say that it was Go Grandma.

And I received another personal message because you triggered me, you see. And also Salome and Alain. So this is the way to contact him.

**(15:46 Telescope teams contact)**
So people will ask me, yeah, but I don't know who is contacted. So you can go to Allocation. And this is all the telescopes in Grandma.

And if I go there, so Allocation, okay, Allocation. And you see who is registered. So the telescope team can modify this page.

Maybe it's not up to date, but this is something that we can see.

**(16:18 Associate to the GW event)**
 So something also interesting to do is, for example, this, remember, this event was associated to 18H. So we can go up and find out 18H.

So, for example, it's a bit old. So I go through GCN. So it's GWGRB Neutrino. And I put 013, 05. Do we have something? CDH, yeah, this is this one. No.

Looks strange, but anyway. And here, to the corresponding alert, you can write a message. I have added a source in Skyportal related to that event. For example.

**(17:41 Report GCN results in skyportal)**
 Okay, so this is good to always keep track on things. The question is, so I suggest from the GCN effect, which would be very, very good, is like, you just like start.

And as soon as there are GCN related to the event, you just copy-paste them and mention them in Skyportal. So, for example, if I took a, oh, so it was 21K. Okay, so we cannot do that.

Anyway, so just check that this is the correct event, because here, this is 21K. But I make a mistake, because this is not 21K, this is 18R. So I made a mistake, so I can delete my comment.
And I can go back to find 21K. Search. This is 21K.

So, we're there. And you can do that so that the next shifter can understand when a look that I have, I create some source for that. So, if, for example, the source was not interesting, but you add it, 

**(19:38 When you decide not to follow-up)**
you can make a statue like Notacare, you know, so that, you know, it will help GRANDMA to understand.

So, let me see if I have sent, yeah. So now, the telescopes team, imagine that they have observed something. So remember that in the last campaign, there was needed to add in the logbook the photometry.

**(20:03 Photometry from GRANDMA)**
So here, if they give you the, for example, this year, that the photometry is at ###. So, if they told you that, or if they do that in the logbook, you can, yourself, using the same formula as last time, and enter the corresponding instrument. Okay, so it's really better to do it via Skyportal.

Or, you can look, and I will ask the telescopes team to do that, at the logbook, when normally they have uploaded a file that looks like, that looks like, that looks like this. When you have the source, and maybe they can provide the name of the source, maybe. Here, name of the source.

They have provided in which filter they have observed, and the magnitude. So, if they provide that in a file, maybe it is easier. But any case, you, the FA, is responsible to add all the photometry that is within GCN.

Okay, because you need to do that. And maybe you can, at the end of your shift, saying that I have stopped looking at GCN up to, for example, So, for example, me is 97. 3-3-8-5-7.
3-3-8-5-7. 3-3-8-5-7. 3-3-8-5-7.

You know, so that the next shifter can understand that you are there. Okay, so this is the big stats of the FA. Of course, you cannot be just on your screen and just, like, say, yeah, I'm looking at my email, but you can, you know, look regularly, like, every, like, two or three times during your shift.

**(22:37 Bonus: send circular)**
Got it? The last one that I would like to show you is, like, with this NASAGov circular view, this is also the way that we will send the circular to everyone. So, there was some bug during Goal 3. This is for part number 4. It will be managed by your weekly coordinator, but at least we capture the candidate sequence. So, thank you for your time.
I will pause this video right now and take care of you. Bye.
