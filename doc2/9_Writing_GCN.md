# 9. GCN Release Protocol

A GCN (Gamma-ray Coordinate Network) Circular is to be released when GRANDMA has begun obtaining images from an observation of an alert. The responsibility of writing a GCN typically falls to the weekly coordinator or the scientist currently observing. However, if others are asleep and you (the FA) are on duty, you might need to write the GCN yourself. You will be alerted if this is the case, but if images have been uploaded or observations are being processed, it might be time to ask, “Are we releasing a GCN?” to a core team member.

### GCN Circular Purpose
GCNs are part of the response to an alert. They serve to:
- Acknowledge the detection of a source candidate or the lack thereof.
- Include the upper limits of an observation.
- Announce these observations to the community.

### GCN Preparation
- Check OwnCloud for the alert. Under “Candidates,” you should find a draft or use a previously submitted GCN within an alert file as an outline.
- GCNs can vary in content: it could be a compilation of all observations done by GRANDMA or just one of GRANDMA’s telescopes.

### Release Timing
GCNs are released upon receiving upper limits. Look out for instructions from the core team regarding the specific designation.

#### Examples of GCN Releases:
- For a single telescope with no source candidate detected, try [GCN 36284}(https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/36284?query=GRANDMA&startDate=&endDate=).
- For several GRANDMA telescopes with no source candidate detected and upper limits. [Try these.](https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/36299?query=GRANDMA&startDate=&endDate=)
