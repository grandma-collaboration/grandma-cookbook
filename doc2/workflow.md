# The Workflows

### Think Like an Observer  
The most important aspect of GRANDMA is ensuring **rapid and efficient response**. Timely follow-up and communication are essential.

## New Event Workflow

1. **Receive Alert**  
   - Via `#gwalerts` on Slack or GCN Circulars via email  
   ↓  

2. **Read Alert Content**  
   - Check `#gwalerts` or the relevant GCN  
   ↓  

3. **Determine Follow-Up**  
   - Assess whether the event warrants observation  
   ↓  

4. **Create a Source Page in SkyPortal**  
   - Add the following details:
     - Classification  
     - T0 (Trigger time)  
     - GCN Crossmatch  
     - Observability  
     - Comments (ongoing, does not need to be done at source creation)  
     - Summary (ongoing, does not need to be done at source creation)  
   ↓  

5. **Generate Observability Plot & Determine Who Can Observe**  
   - Should be done at least twice in a shift  
   ↓  

6. **Report Event Details to `#observations`**  
   - For **GW**: say **FOLLOW UP** or **NO FOLLOW UP**  
   - For **GRBs**: report only interesting events  
   ↓  

7. **Request Telescopes to Observe in `#observations`**  
   - For **GWs**: plans will take about 15 minutes to generate, unless event is `HIGH PRIORITY`  
     - Report the event to `#observations` and alert the channel when plans are generated  
     - If they are not generated, ask a core team member or your WC  
   - For **GRBs**: proceed without delay  
   ↓  

8. **Wait for Images**  
   ↓  

9. **Update Shift Documents & SkyPortal Comments**  
   - Make comments in SkyPortal on **ALL activity**  
   - Every change in SkyPortal and every request/feedback in `#observations` should be reported in SkyPortal comments  
   - This can be done periodically throughout your shift  
   ↓  

10. **Check GCNs for Photometry, Redshift, Updated Coordinates**  
   ↓  

11. **Upload GCN Photometry to SkyPortal**  
   ↓  

12. **Add/Update Summary of Event**  
   ↓  

13. **End of Shift**  
   - Clearly document all activity and telescopes contacted in your shift document for the next shifter

## Ongoing Observation Workflow

1. **Check Shift Documents / SkyPortal Comments**  
   ↓  

2. **Determine Who Has Observed**  
   ↓  

3. **Generate Observability Plot & Determine Who Can Observe**  
   - Should be done at least twice in a shift  
   ↓  

4. **Request Observations Again (if needed)**  
   - Especially if no observation has occurred in several hours  
   - Clear documentation is important  
   ↓  

5. **Check for New Images**  
   - Update comments/shift document  
   ↓  

6. **Synthesize Images**  
   ↓  

7. **Check GCNs for Photometry, Redshift, Updated Coordinates**  
   ↓  

8. **Upload Additional Photometry to SkyPortal**  
   ↓  

9. **Update Summary of Event**  
   ↓  

10. **STOP?**  
   - Stop when **no counterpart is detected after 24 hours** of observing,  
     or the **magnitude is reaching 21+**.
