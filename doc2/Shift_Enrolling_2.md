## 2. Enrolling in Shifts

**Note:** The starting of each weekly slot will be after the GRANDMA telecon, on Thursdays at CET. The week will have four shift slots per day, with one slot taken by the weekly coordinator. The slot of the weekly coordinator will be used for doubling up with someone new for training/support. The daily shift rota will be at 00:00 CET, 06:00 CET, 12:00 CET, and 23:59 CET.

If you are new to GRANDMA and would like to better understand your role within the collaboration, Sarah has made helpful videos explaining them:

For both weekly coordinators and FAs, you can find videos below to help you subscribe to a shift of your preference. The videos have transcripts in Section 7 of this document.

### 2.1 Communication Between FAs

Communication between FAs and the weekly coordinator is crucial. We encourage frequent communication not only with the WC but also with other FAs. The weekly coordinator (WC) will create a Slack channel for your group. If one of you cannot attend your shift for a few hours or a day, you can ask for re-arrangement in that channel from other teammates. If you need help with shift work or scheduling, seek assistance within your team first before contacting a core member. If you notice that the previous shifter did not complete all tasks, it is YOUR responsibility to fill the gap and ensure tasks are not left incomplete. It is also courteous to inform the FA of any uncompleted tasks. Accidents happen!

Here are some examples of communication between FAs. These are optional.

**Note:** As an FA, remember to annotate all events with new circulars coming in SkyPortal.

**Previous FA to the Next FA**

- **New Events:**
  - `S230601bf`: BBH far away, significant (annotation on SkyPortal done but labelization is missing; you need to take care of it), waiting for interesting transients
- **GCN Tracker:**
  - Keep track of GCN circulars > 33903
- **Further Events:**
  - `S2329ay`: Source candidate from ZTF (GCN33900): ZTF23aapmnpce needs to be labelized correctly once photometric data have been imported
  - `AT2023`: Source candidate is observing with KAO, waiting for improved weather in ShAO. No response from the UBAI team regarding observations
- **Technical Issue:**
  - `S230601bf` didn't produce any #gwalerts notifications; Sarah will capture this
