### How to Respond to Different Astrophysical Alerts

## Responding to BBH Alerts in GRANDMA

### A) Criteria for BBH Follow-Up
BBH follow-up is required if any of the following conditions are met:
- **Well localized**: Sky localization area is less than 200 deg².
- **Very close**: Distance is less than 200 Mpc with a 90% credible region (CR) of less than 1000 deg².
- **Joint detection**: Counterpart detected from Neutrinos or GRBs.

**Examples**:
- BBH at 180 Mpc with a 90% CR of 50 deg²: **Yes, Follow-Up**
- BBH at 500 Mpc with a 90% CR of 100 deg²: **Yes, Follow-Up**
- BBH at 60 Mpc with a 90% CR of 4000 deg²: **No**
- BBH at 60 Mpc with a 90% CR of 4000 deg² + GRB: **Yes, Follow-Up**
- BBH at 80 Mpc with a 90% CR of 500 deg²: **Yes, Follow-Up**

### B) Determining Follow-Up Strategy
1. **If BBH is < 200 Mpc or < 200 deg²**:
   - **Trigger All Telescopes**: Use both Tiling and Galaxy Targeting for 24 hours.
   - **Next Steps**: Trigger follow-up on counterpart candidates reported in GCN.
   - **Start Follow-Up on Candidates**: Begin as soon as they appear in GCN.
   - **Stop Follow-Up**: When it’s no longer scientifically valuable.
   - **Tags in GRANDMA**: Start and stop GRANDMA properly; don’t leave "Go GRANDMA" indefinitely.

2. **If BBH is > 200 Mpc or > 200 deg²**:
   - **Limited Follow-Up**: Use TAROT (TCH, TCA, TRE) and FRAM (Auger, CTA-N) for 24 hours.
   - **If Counterparts are Reported in GCN**: Trigger all GRANDMA telescopes.

### C) Triggering Wide Field Telescopes (TAROT, FRAM)
- **Check Telescope Availability**: Use the GCN SkyPortal page to see which telescopes can observe.
- **Generate Plan in SkyPortal**: Be mindful of bugs (e.g., TCH) and ensure you use the most updated alert version.
- **Notify Team**: Email Sergey and Martin Masek for FRAM, Sarah Antier, and Alain Klotz for TAROT.
