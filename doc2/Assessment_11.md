## Section 3: Short Scenario-Based Questions

**Scenario 1:**
You receive a gravitational wave alert that appears to be a BNS merger within 150 Mpc, and the localization area is 180 deg². Describe the steps you would take to notify the telescope teams and begin observations.

**Scenario 2:**
You are on duty, and a telescope team has reported that they have started observations and uploaded images to the ownCloud. How would you proceed with the GCN Circular and coordination with the core team?

**Scenario 3:**
After initial observations, a transient candidate is identified by an external team. How would you handle the follow-up with GRANDMA’s telescopes, and what would your report include?

## Section 4: Long Scenario-Based Questions

**Note: The following are fabricated events. You do not need to refer to SkyPortal.**

### Scenario Event 1: GW Candidate S230621ab
**Context**: You receive an alert for GW candidate S230621ab during your shift. The alert arrives at 02:30 UTC, and it is detected by three interferometers.

**Questions**:

**Alert Review:**
- **Q1.1**: What is the first thing you should do after receiving the alert?
- **Q1.2**: How can you determine whether this event is astrophysical or noise?

**Event Classification:**
- **Q1.3**: The event is classified as BBH. What does this mean for potential electromagnetic (EM) follow-up?
- **Q1.4**: Should this event be considered high-profile? What factors would lead you to that conclusion?

**Sky Localization:**
- **Q1.5**: The 90% credible region of the sky localization area is 500 deg². How does this affect the observation strategy?
- **Q1.6**: If the event’s distance is 150 Mpc with an error of ± 20 Mpc, how does that influence your decision to notify telescope teams?

**Action Plan:**
- **Q1.7**: Based on the information available, should you instruct the telescope teams to begin observations? Why or why not?

### Scenario Event 2: GW Candidate S230708kl
**Context**: It’s the middle of your shift, and you receive a new alert for GW candidate S230708kl. The event is detected by two interferometers and is classified as BNS.

**Questions**:

**Alert Review:**
- **Q2.1**: The alert arrives at 10:45 UTC. Is it a fresh alert, and how can you determine if it is the first message for this alert within GRANDMA?

**Event Classification:**
- **Q2.2**: The event is classified as BNS, and the distance is 180 Mpc with an error of ± 10 Mpc. How does this classification affect your decision-making?
- **Q2.3**: Why is the detection of a neutron star in this binary system significant for GRANDMA?

**Sky Localization:**
- **Q2.4**: The 50% credible region of the skymap is 100 deg², and the 90% credible region is 400 deg². How should you prioritize telescopes with smaller fields of view?

**Action Plan:**
- **Q2.5**: Given the event's proximity and classification, should you mark it as high-profile? If so, what are the next steps in coordinating observations?
- **Q2.6**: How should you communicate with the telescope teams, considering some are currently in daytime and cannot observe immediately?

## Scenario Event 3: GW Candidate S230816yz
**Context**: A new alert for GW candidate S230816yz arrives during your shift. It is classified as NSBH and detected by four interferometers. The event’s distance is 90 Mpc with an error of ± 5 Mpc.

**Questions**:

**Alert Review:**
- **Q3.1**: Upon receiving the alert, what should your immediate actions be to confirm its importance?
- **Q3.2**: How can you verify that the alert has been communicated to the relevant teams in GRANDMA?

**Event Classification:**
- **Q3.3**: The event is classified as NSBH. What does this mean for potential electromagnetic counterparts, and how does that affect GRANDMA’s strategy?

**Sky Localization:**
- **Q3.4**: The 90% credible region of the skymap is 150 deg². How would you approach coordinating observations with telescope teams that have wide-field capabilities versus those with narrower fields of view?

**Action Plan:**
- **Q3.5**: Given the small error in distance and the classification of the event, should this event be marked as high-profile? Justify your answer.
- **Q3.6**: How would you report this event to the next FA on shift and the weekly coordinator?

## Scenario 4: GW Candidate S231003xy
**Context**: You receive an alert for GW candidate S231003xy during the final hour of your shift. The event is detected by three interferometers, and the alert classifies it as a BBH with a distance of 300 Mpc ± 50 Mpc.

**Questions**:

**Alert Review:**
- **Q4.1**: How would you assess the priority of this event given its classification and distance?
- **Q4.2**: Should you notify telescope teams to observe this event? Explain your reasoning.

**Event Classification:**
- **Q4.3**: Given that BBH events generally do not produce electromagnetic counterparts, under what circumstances would you still consider a follow-up?

**Sky Localization:**
- **Q4.4**: The skymap shows that the 90% credible region covers 600 deg². How does this affect the feasibility of rapid follow-up observations?

**Action Plan:**
- **Q4.5**: As your shift is ending soon, how should you transition this alert to the next FA on shift? What details are most important to pass along?
- **Q4.6**: If the weekly coordinator provides additional guidance on this event, how should you incorporate it into your final actions?

## Scenario 5: GW Candidate S231020gh (False Alarm)
**Context**: During your shift, you receive an alert for GW candidate S231020gh, detected by only one interferometer. Shortly after, you receive an update indicating that the event is likely a false alarm.

**Questions**:

**Alert Review:**
- **Q5.1**: What should be your immediate actions upon receiving the initial alert?
- **Q5.2**: How do you verify that the alert has been flagged as a false alarm, and what steps should you take to communicate this to the telescope teams?

**Event Classification:**
- **Q5.3**: If the event had not been flagged as a false alarm, what criteria would you have used to assess its significance?

**Sky Localization:**
- **Q5.4**: The initial skymap indicated a large uncertainty in localization. How does this influence your decision-making process for follow-up observations?

**Action Plan:**
- **Q5.5**: How do you document the false alarm and ensure that all relevant teams are informed to avoid unnecessary observations?
- **Q5.6**: How should you transition this case to the next FA on shift, ensuring that no further follow-up is conducted?
