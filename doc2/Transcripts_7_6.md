### 7.6 Plans, Images, Photometry (telescope teams)


**(00:00 Intro)**
Hello everyone, so now I'm going to show you how to have access to the plan of your observation.

**(00:11 prequeries which observations)**
 So remember that in the last video we were talking about the different type of observations that you can make, either within the galaxy, in the field of view, or just tiling in the field of view. This observation should be done within 24 hours, and if you cannot observe during these 24 hours, you need to only observe the gravitational wave source candidates, or what we call the transients, that the FA and the shifter will guide you which candidates you need to observe.

And this within 72 hours, and in case of that the contemporary has been detected, you need to follow up as deep as you can the candidates, but we will have another prize. 

**(01:10 tasks of telescope teams)**
So let me now see the different steps that I would like to show you in this video. So we have notify, so we show in the last video how to get notified from Skyportal, and you need to tell the FA, the follow-up advocate, in observation that you will or will not, you receive or you did not receive the alert.

Of course if you're sleeping or it's not the time that you're going to perform observation, you can say, yeah, we're observing a delay, or you check the weather. So the first step is to get notified, but also to notify the people that you're going to observe or not within 24 hours. The second task that you need to do is observing, the most funny part maybe, either galaxy or tilings or candidates in the 24 hours, 72 hours, depending on where you are.

And then number three of your task is to submit as soon as they come the image. So remember that for the image we need the astrometry in it, not only just whole image without dark, black, etc. So this is very important, the image.

And then within the next two days, three days, the photometry results. So now I'm going to share my screen, I'm going to show in my screen where you can, so notify, we already saw it in the last video, so just observe. So the observation plan, so let me go to my... So now I am, so remember that we have this alert, 230511CP.

Normally you have been notified by, sorry, it's in GW. 

**(03:23 access observation plan slack)**
So normally you have been notified because you're registered in GW alert. This is the first message preliminary.
And in the last video, I show you that how to receive the alert via Skyportal or via Slack or via phone. And then after a while, you see, so as I said, in the next 10, 15 minutes, you have this plan coming. And you can click on link, on the link.

So I click on the link, like I can do like you. 

**(04:00 owncloud presentation)**
And you see, so the name of the event, 230511CP. So this is true.

You have the different folder that you know about. Image, you can see image, logbook, new event. So logbook, it is where you're going to upload the photometry.

And GWEMOPT, in fact, is a new folder. So I click here. 

**(04:25 gwemopt)**
You have here two folders.

So if alert just come, there is just one. This is preliminary. You see, it's arrived earlier than this one because it's the first message.

So if I click on preliminary, I have access to two folders. Galaxy targeting and tiling. So if I go back, for example, I am TCA.

So I received a plan from tiling. So I go to tiling. And then I have access to my plan here.

And so you can see, it's not only one point that I need to follow up. Here is five fields. So you have the name, so TCA.

Yeah, it's me because I need to have started with TCA. Rank ID, one, two, three, four, five. So usually the one is the one with the best chance to have the source candidate in it.

The gravitational wave counterpart in it. And then you have tile ID. So this is more technical.

It is for us. So don't take care of it. And then you have the coordinate when you point the telescope.

So this is the center of, you need to point the telescope within the center. So within the center of this tile. And then you have, so the probability.

To, so sorry, this is RA/DEC, sorry. So this is RA and DEC. And this is a probability that the source is within this field.

And here, this is the tile according to your telescopes, because this is only a plan for TCA, for which you can observe. So for example, it can be observed at 8 UTC, of course, because TCA can observe during when it is around this time in France. So like 10 p.m. And I can, so all this tile I can observing straight away.

Sometimes you can see that a tile, it's better to observe the tile at the beginning because here it gives you really the scheduling, in fact. So even if this tile is more important to observe, maybe it's not the first one that you can observe within your night. And so if I am another telescope, you see, so the ops time will be different because, of course, Thierry, which is in La RÃ©union, so in India, the Pacific, in the Indian Sea, I don't remember how to say it, or the ocean, can observe earlier.

So if you are regarding who you are, you need to pick up the plan and start observation within. So for example, me, I would like to observe TCA. 

**(07:55 notify FA in skyportal)**
So I go to observation.

And I said, I received the plan. And I will start observing with TCA. And it's good to say ID 1 and tile ID, for example.

Tile ID, so ID 1 and tile ID. Okay. So this, I can also, as we saw last time, to put it here and add comment.

Because it's better because we keep it. So it's better, it's good to do in both ways, but it's better to do it in I-Care if you just want to do it for one. So I am doing the observation.

And so imagine, sorry, so I am looking at the plan. It's good to say from preliminary. And it's good one to check which plan and maybe to put the coordinate of the source.

So let me go back. Sorry. Tiling.

TCA, so the first one, this one. Okay. Why? Because, so it comes to my second point.

**(09:38 update vs preliminary)**
Maybe, so for example, I am TCA. I cannot observe right now. It is only 1 p.m. in France.

So maybe later, there will be an updated plan, as I said. So an updated plan for which the coordinates won't be the same. And this is a problem because I'm sure that some of you will confuse.

And you need to be very vigilant. So that's why it's good to, yeah, to copy-paste. Maybe just simply restart TCA and you just copy-paste this line.

So that everyone understands and there is no confusion. Okay. Okay.

So if, for example, tonight I see that there is an update, then I took the observation from the update plan. I won't took the one from the preliminary. And how do you know if there is a new plan or not? So it is again, if I go back to #gwalerts.

Yeah. So for example, this was a message from the preliminary. You see, preliminary.

But after a while, up, there has been another message from the same candidate. 230511cp. You see that it is an update.

And you see that the plan has been computed again. So you need to be very careful. So the plan is different.

For example, here it was 5 field, 7.3% of observation of the total credible region. While in this file, it was only 1%. For here, I computed more test scores.

But anyway, you need to be very, very learned for which plan you need to take when you start observation. Because if you don't start observation immediately, you need to wait. As TCA, it's better to take the most updated plan, the update one.

In any case, you have some problem to understand which plan you need to use, just contact the FA in observation. So like, I am confused about the plan. Okay.

**(12:23 reporting images)**
So imagine now you have observe, and you have an image. I have prepared something for you. So I have an image, and I need to upload it.

So again, I go to image, stack, and then I upload in my image. So as you see, so this is my image from TCA. But this is a wrong name.

As you see, we have a real, I mean, we have a way to name fit image in GRANDMA. So my image should start. So maybe, okay.

**(13:33 naming images)**
My image should be in the way of the name of the GW alert. So GW alert. My name as observer, the name of the telescopes, the time I have observed.

So I have observed, we say at 20. In which filters, if it is stack, so yes, then the number of image per exposure time. And here, I added this number.

So it corresponds to the pointing of the source. So if you, normally it's, so this is, yeah. And this is DEC.

So for a question of format is, I ask you to put this between so that we have our stuff. So which means that this is a coordinate that you have, I mean, the coordinates you have observed because you have different coordinates, different pointing to observe. So if you just put, if you put just nothing, then I need to report for a report.

That's fine because I have observed this. So I put again in my name. Okay.

To be sure that we understood that this image is, okay. So maybe this will change, but for the moment, we will keep it like this. And so I need to rename my GRANDMA that fits in with this name.

So I go to image type. Okay. Okay.

So let's see the OwnCloud. I mean, in the web, you can see that. Yeah.

So it has a good name. Sarah is happy. Maybe there are two time bits.

So we'll do it properly. So this is the correct name. What else? So then the second thing you need to do.

**(16:19 photometry in owncloud)**
So yeah, remember that this, it needs to be with astrometry. And then I need to upload my CSV, my result. So you need to create this by here.

I just created to show you. So I need to say which time I observe. Okay.

So can I turn it now? So I will turn it here. Which time I observe. So it was 25, 11.

You need to make it more property, but here is just an example. TCA. Here I put the filter that I, so here is MGD.

So you need to convert it. Here I put the filter clean in from Skyportal, et cetera, et cetera. As we did last time.

And I have done, this is me that done analysis. But for GW, you need to add as well the coordinate of the source once again. Because you will have multiple photometry.

So the source was that I observe. This one, again, this is the image corresponding to this one. And I've done my photometry for that.

So I just go back. Okay. And I add the source here at the beginning.

So here I am happy. And you need to do that because you have, so let me read. In logbook.

So you need to create that because you don't have, so you see the source is there now. And you need to create this file as a telescope team. Sorry, I'm getting a bit tired.

Because this is your role and the follow-up advocate will help you. But anyway, this is your task to do. 

**(18:49 photometry in skyportal)**
There is also another way to register, for example, some observation.

Is to go by Skyportal via this formula. I think you're already trained. If you need help, I need to do another video.

So thank you everyone to have listened to me for this technical part. And bye-bye.
