### 7.9 Non-European weekly coordinators : How to create a shift in Skyportal

**(00:00 - 00:45:)** I would like to create a video for a person that would like to be a weekly coordinator but is not working in Paris time or in Europe time. And I would like to show how to create a shift when you are not in Europe. So let me share my screen. 

**(00:45 - 1:16:)**  Here first you need to connect to skyportal-icare.ijclab.in2p3.fr and you go to the screen and then you go down to the shift - Dashboard, Sources, Candidate and Shifts. I click here. For the moment what you see is, this kind of things, may you don’t have the same scale here because you are not working in Paris time zone. You have something different. 

**(1:16 - 1:33:)** And if I go next, next, next, I see some slots that are already filled, because in fact me Sarah, I have already filled the slots and I see only the ones that I am associated with. For example, my filled slots, nice. 

**(1:33 - 1:53:)** If I would like to see all the shifts, then I click on show all the shifts up, show all shifts. And then I see all the shifts from my other colleagues. So for example, this one is with admin Martin Blazek. Whereas this one is me.

**(1:53 - 2:16:)** Here the idea today is to know how to create a shift on a week when you are not in France or in Europe. The shift does not start from Monday to Sunday. It starts from Thursday to the next Thursday,

**(2:16 - 2:55:)** thats why for this slot, thats called Kenza team start on Thursday night in Paris and ends on Thursday afternoon. So it always start at 6 pm French time. So 4 pm UTC time. So now I will show how to create this slot when you are not in Paris but when you are in USA or in Asia. 

**(2:55 - 3:42:)** So for example, if I like to be a weekly coordinator and I want to create the shift from Thursday 3rd to Thursday 10th. So I am not in Paris, so I don’t see the same Paris time. I clicked on add new shift on top right and choose group “GRANDMA”, shift name party, number of users 2, description nothing, divide it by day - very important, and then here it is not local time, it is UTC time. Then we are 8, 8 in 8. It starts in August and finished in August. 

**(3:42 - 4:36:)** It starts on Thursday 3rd, and finished on Wednesday 9 for the moment. So the first slot in UTC will start at 4 pm and will finish at 10. I just do that because we don’t want overlap. So 4 to this, divide it by day, 2 slots, Party, GRANDMA. Everything is fine. 

**(4:36 - 5:07:)** So I click submit. And then I have slots here and arriving here. So you see in my view in Paris time, it perfectly fit the other shifter’s slot. So then I will create this slots. But for the next slots, I decided that I will be available as weekly coordinator to also to question to beginner shifter/Followup Advocate.
