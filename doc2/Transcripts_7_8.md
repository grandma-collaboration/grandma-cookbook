### 7.8 GW alert: different types

**(0:00 Introduction)**
Today, I would like to talk about the gravitational wave alerts and in this video we are going to understand what it means gravitational wave alert. In this video, we are going to see how we can be notifies and what are the different types of gravitational wave alerts. 

**(0:23 Notify)**
To be notified in GRANDMA as FA, you need to be registered to #gwalerts channel on slack. In this channel, you will receive different types of alerts.

**(0:40 Preliminary)**
The first type of alert you will receive when an event is detected by LVK is a PRELIMINARY alert. This alert arrives when the objects has already collided and the system on LVK takes a few second to a few minutes to process. This is the PRELIMINARY alert that and it has a skymap associated with it. This way  we can point our telescopes. 

**(1:25 Early)**
LVK, in fact, before the PRELIMINARY has also delivered publicly an early warning alert. We do not follow up in GRANDMA because there is no skymap associated with it so its not worth it to listen. The early warning happened before the PRELIMINARY.

**(1:58 Preliminary)**
 In GRANDMA, we focus on the PRELIMINARY alert. If you are a shifter, you receive a PRELIMINARY warning on #gwalerts. 

**(2:15 Initial)**
The gravitational wave experts in LVK also receive the PRELIMINARY alert and they are woken up to understand whether or not it comes from an astrophysical event or not. After a while, theyâ€™re going to send an INITIAL alert. For the INITIAL, it happens in several dozens of minutes, to one hour, to several hours and sometimes INITIAL is not sent to the community or is never received by GRANDMA. It is important because in case it is finally not astrophysics you will receive a retraction from the INITIAL statues. 

**(3:11 Update)**
After hours or one day, we receive an UPDATE alert from the same event. From the same event: we have PRELIMINARY, INITIAL and UPDATE alerts. So, when you're a shifter, you can receive an UPDATE alert where the previous alerts occurred during a previous shift.


**(3:42 Deal with all the alerts)**
So, as a shifter, you need to treat all the alerts, whether you have received PRELIMINARY alerts during your shift or not. 

**(3:56 Skymaps)**
In the UPDATE, we use all the parameter space of gravitational waves to construct the skymap. This skymap and the localization error is different from the INITIAL and PRELIMINARY. In fact, in our grandma paper, we use the update skymap to produce our results. But, we usually follow up with the PRELIMINARY and the INITIAL. Usually, the PRELIMINARY and INITIAL has the same skymap. The INITIAL skymap is a confirmation of the PRELIMINARY skymap. Sometimes, the skymap is different and as a FA you may need to redirect some kind of viewpoints after the initial. Usually, the update arrives too late to change the plan because the plan is already finished and the UPDATE is only for the paper. 

**(05:06 Conclusions)**
You will be notified by the #gwalerts. You will receive PRELIMINARY which is extremely important, and the one that we wake up to. You can then face an INITIAL that will tell you if an event is astrophysical or not. Then, several hours later you will receive an UPDATE that provides the final skymap.
