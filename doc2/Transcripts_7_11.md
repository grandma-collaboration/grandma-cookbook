### 7.11 Managing the ZTF candidates (follow-up advocate training)

**(0:02 - 0:15):**
So hello, Grandma. So after a presentation I made on the Grandma Telecon of Thursday, I was asked to make a video about the ZTF candidates management. So here it is.

**(0:16 - 0:31):**
So the topic of this video is to explain or give some information about how to deal with ZTF counterpart candidate. And basically, we have two ways of receiving these alerts. So the first is via ZTF Team GCNs.

**(0:31 - 1:02):**
In that case, we as shifters or follow-up advocate, we have to add the candidates and the photometry on Skyportal. The second way to receive those alerts is via the theme broker on Skyportal main page. And in that case, a follow-up advocate, we have to update the tag from iCare or to not iCare or ask for follow-up if you think that the candidate is interesting and want follow-up.

**(1:03 - 1:29):**
The question is how to deal with these candidates and how to make the decision to trigger their network to perform follow-up observations. And the basic things to do is, in my opinion, to go on the fink web portal that you can access via this URL and type the ID of the alert. So that should look like ZTF23 and a bunch of letters that correspond to the unique ID of the transient.

**(1:30 - 2:01):**
It may appear that the alert is not available in Fink. For example, if the candidate has been added manually on Skyportal and it has not automatically been filtered by the classifier of Think. In that case, another way to have information on these candidates is to go on another ZTF broker, such as ALeRCE or Lasair, with those two web URLs.

**(2:05 - 2:34):**
The question is, as a follow-up advocate, to make a decision about whether or not the transient should be followed. It's particularly difficult when we have only one or two points of photometry. Which is the situation we most likely will have to face during a shift because the transient will be detected just after a gravitational wave transient.

**(2:34 - 2:56):**
And then we will have a very few points. So I'd like to propose some criterions to veto ZTF candidates proposed by Fink. So maybe the first natural thing to do is to cross-match the position of these alerts with the most recent gravitational wave alerts.

**(2:56 - 3:36):**
If none of the two, three previous gravitational wave alerts don't have the localization that includes some of these ZTF alerts, well, the alert is not worth following up. It's not a good candidate for being an electromagnetic counterpart. If it appears that a ZTF alert is coincident in space with a gravitational wave, then another thing to do is to go on the Fink web portal and check the classification.

**(3:36 - 4:04):**
If the candidate has been classified as something that's not a kilonova, such as a solar system object or supernovae, well, it's probably unrelated to the gravitational wave alerts and doesn't require any more follow-up. You may face the case where Fink classification is inconclusive. For example, if it's mixed between three or four different categories, or if it's classified as unknown by Think.

**(4:04 - 4:39):**
In that case, the alerts broker might help you for making a decision. Although we have to also keep in mind that grammar collaboration is closely related to the Fink collaboration, and that's not the case for the alerts one. If we have questions regarding the classification or the way the alerts are filtered by the alerts, it will be much more difficult to have information.

**(4:39 - 5:13):**
We should primarily refocus and keep our decision based on Fink information. Another good criterion to veto or not some ZTF candidates is to check when was the last detection. Beyond three to five days, that's probably not interesting anymore, in particular, if we're looking for kilonovae, because those kind of transient are expected to decay extremely rapidly with a rate of 0.3 to 0.5 magnitude per day, based on 170817.

**(5:14 - 5:48):**
After three to five days, especially considering the distance at which gravitational waves are detected, we won't be able to observe these transient with most of the grammar instruments. If no one else reported that it was a credible kilonovae candidate, it's probably not interesting anymore. A last criterion that could be easy to check is to look at the luminosity decay rate.

**(5:48 - 6:13):**
If it's below 0.3 magnitude per day, it's probably not a kilonovae. This decay rate is based on the gravitational wave detected in August 2017. Although this is not a hard limit, so it can be a bit above or a bit below these thresholds.

**(6:14 - 6:30):**
And we should be open-minded, because we don't have a lot of information about kilonovae diversity. And after all those criterions, I would like also to warn about what I just said. So these are basic rule of thumbs.

**(6:31 - 7:08):**
None of those criteria should be a hard stop, especially when we are looking at BNS gravitational wave candidates, because in that case, we expect electromagnetic emission. And we should be extra careful and look actually at the GCN from other collaborations. However, these returns should be easy to deal with most binary black hole merger cases, as we do not expect much electromagnetic counterpart in those events.

**(7:09 - 8:58):**
Although we should also not hesitate too much to ask for GRANDMA members help when some candidates are ambiguous, because we would be very sorry to miss some kilonovae, because we were not completely sure about what we were dealing with. Now that I have some of these representations, I'd like to give some examples that I actually had to deal with during my follow-up advocacy shift a few days ago. So like I said, on the Skyportal on I-care, you have here the gravitational alerts that are displayed.

And here on this panel, you have the ZTF kilonovae candidates provided by Fink. And I'd like to give two examples that actually happened during my shift. So these alerts, so ZTF23AANPZMV and ZTF23AANFWYW.

So those two alerts were recorded on Skyportal here for PZMV and WYW here. So they were classified as kilonovae candidates. So the first thing we have done is to go on the Skyportal web portal.

So this is the main page of the broker. And I typed here the ZTF ID, so these names here that are displayed on my tabs. After that, it get me to the Fink web portal page link related to these alerts.

**(8:59 - 9:44):**
So at the time of my shift for this alert, so WYW, I only had those points. And it was five days after the detection that we had to make the decision on whether or not to continue the follow-up. So based on that, my thoughts were that it was detected five days ago, so quite an old alert with only one detection.

If it was a kilonovae, GRANDMA would not be able to do much, especially with most instruments. And in addition, at that time, the Fink classification was not in favor of a kilonovae. It was more classified as unknown or either supernovae.

**(9:45 - 10:07):**
So based on those information, I decided to just go for a not ICARE. The second alert I had was sort of PZMV. And in that case, there were no information on Skype portal, on the Fink Skype portal, because it was this transient was added manually.

**(10:07 - 10:44):**
So it has no webpage because it has been classified with Fink. But at that time, I had to go on the ALERS ZTF Explorer broker and check for the classification provided by ALERS. And the classification was it was an asteroid.

So I decided, based on this information, to just not ICARE. I decided to type not ICARE on Skype portal. And yeah.

**(10:46 - 11:22):**
I also had a look on the other transient on ALeRCE, and it appeared that it was classified as a bogus in ALeRCE. And so it confirmed my classification of not ICARE for those two alerts. So I think it will be all for that video.

I'd like to thank you for listening, and I wish you were a good shift and a good O4 run.
