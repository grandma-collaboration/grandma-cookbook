# 10. FA Responsibility Outline

The Follow-Up Advocate’s (FA) role is to notify telescope teams at the time of a gravitational wave alert and help them point the telescopes at the correct location in the sky. As an FA or shifter, you need to verify that an alert has been received and ensure that observations are performed for the best scientific return in gravitational wave astronomy. GRANDMA operates with a 24/7 schedule divided into 4 slots. As an FA, you work during a Thursday-Thursday week, completing one 6-hour shift per day. You will have a Weekly Coordinator to guide and mentor you.

For an overview on the FA's responsibilities and the use of skyportal, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N7fgiPfiXA). The transcript can be found in Section 12: Transcripts. 

### Task 1 - GW Alert

1. **Determine Alert Profile**: 
   - Assess if the gravitational wave (GW) alert is high-profile or routine. Actions vary based on the alert’s significance.
   - **Determine if the GW is high-profile**:
     - Verify if the source is astrophysical, as some alerts may be noise.
     - Check if it is a coalescence of two neutron stars (BNS) or a neutron star and a black hole (NSBH), as these are expected sources of optical signatures.
     - Assess the distance of the event. If it's below 200 Mpc, it’s considered high-profile.
     - Evaluate the sky localization area. If it’s below 200 square degrees, it’s high-profile.
     - Note the number of interferometers detecting the event. A score from 1 to 3 will be produced, where 1 is not very interesting, 2 is moderately interesting, and 3 is high profile. You are responsible for verifying the profile.

2. **Receive Alerts**:
   - Alerts can come through Slack, SkyPortal, or phone. SkyPortal is hosted through Slack.

### Task 2 - Notify Telescopes

What does it mean to notify the telescope teams? The telescope teams may have already received the alert automatically. But, you need to guarantee that they have received it and they are starting to observe - if it is nighttime for them. 

1. **Ensure Telescope Teams are Notified**:
   - Confirm that telescope teams have received the alert and are observing.
   - Communicate with telescope teams via the GRANDMA Slack channel #observations.
   - Consider the observability conditions (e.g., weather, source visibility) when coordinating observations. Come back and check in with telescopes who may have reported bad conditions before.
   - Report in SkyPortal comments and to the next FA on shift regarding telescope readiness and observations.

2. **Contact Rules**:
   - Contact telescope teams at least two hours before their local night time for those telescopes that were experiencing daytime at time of alert.
   - Work collaboratively with previous shifters.

### Task 3 - Images

1. **Monitor Image Uploads**:
   - Ensure telescope teams upload images to SkyPortal or OwnCloud with the correct name and format within 24 hours of observation.
   - Verify that photometric results are provided. Seek assistance from the Weekly Coordinator if needed.

### Task 4 - Transient

1. **Identify Transients**:
   - After observing, scanning, and taking images, identify potential GW counterparts.
   - Use SkyPortal and other sources to determine candidates. Direct telescopes to these candidates if necessary.
   - Produce a report for both the community (like the GCN) and GRANDMA detailing observations, sensitivities, and photometry of transient sources. This report should be prepared with the other shifters and the Weekly Coordinator.
