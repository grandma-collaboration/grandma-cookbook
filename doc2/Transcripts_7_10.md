### 7.10 European weekly coordinator How to create a shift in Skyportal

**(0:00 - 0:18):**
Hello everyone, I hope that you're fine. So I'm gonna show you how to set up some shift as weekly coordinator. So weekly coordinator, this video is for weekly coordinators, not for shift weekly coordinator.

**(0:19 - 0:47):**
So let me share my screen. Yeah, one second, I'm sharing the screen. So this is Skyportal, so you need to log on Skyportal, iCare, edclab.ein2p3.fr. And here on the dashboards, there is dashboard, GW, GRB, Neutrino, sources, candidate, favorite, and shift.

**(0:47 - 1:16):**
You click on shift. So normally it is like this, and to show some shift from everyone to see then the slot is visible, you click show all shift. So now we're gonna create, find a slot on shift from May 7, 13 to, so this period is up to August 27.

**(1:18 - 1:53):**
So I will put a slot, let me delete this. So to delete, for example, some slot because I was mistaken, you can do like this, okay. So I would like to, sorry, I would like to create some new shifts in that period because I would like to be a weekly coordinator from 6th of July, Thursday to 13th of July, Thursday.

**(1:55 - 2:06):**
So for that, I will create a new shift. So add new shift. I will find the group GRANDMA and then the shift name, whatever you like.

**(2:06 - 2:18):**
So piupiu, number of user required for the shift. So for this shift at play time, there will be only one shifter and me coordinator. So one plus one, so two.

**(2:19 - 2:26):**
So I put two, three plus question, we don't care. Divide per day, very important to put it. And local time.

**(2:26 - 2:48):**
And here, maybe you don't see the same screen as me because here it is with French time. But obviously, if you go with UTC, it will be with another, in another, it will be another display. So now I use, so I need to put like July 6 with some.

**(2:49 - 3:29):**
So this is the slot of eight, this and this, this. And seven, so seven up to, let's say Thursday, 13th. Thursday, 13th.

**(3:29 - 3:48):**
So Thursday, 13th, no, Thursday, 12th, sorry. Because it's starting on six, but finishing the slot on 12. So 12, and then I need to put 23, 59.

**(3:49 - 3:58):**
59, it's very important not to have overlap. Seven, 12, so I think it's fine. And I'm gonna add it.

**(3:59 - 4:15):**
So now I have my slots. Then I would like to be, so I will be shifter now. So me and another person will be shifter from 12 to six.

**(4:16 - 4:27):**
So I will add, and this is the slot. So if I am with the coordinator and on shift, I will add someone else. I will add something in the description.

**(4:27 - 4:49):**
So I show you, so GRANDMA, shift name, again, piupiu. Then the number of user is the same, but here it's slots only for beginner. Slots only for beginner, yeah.

**(4:49 - 5:17):**
Divided by day, local time. And then I put seven, seven. So this now will not start on six, it will start on seven because it is, we start the shift during 6 p.m. So then the first date for this weekly slot is on seven.

**(5:19 - 5:43):**
So seven, seven, seven, no, not seven, sorry. Seven, so we will up to 13, you see, 13, okay. So here it is, 17, 59, yes.

**(5:45 - 6:02):**
And, and, and, and, 12, 12, okay. So this is my local time, divided by day. Slots only for beginner, GRANDMA, piupiu, and then isolated.

**(6:03 - 6:12):**
So here we go, there is these things up to Thursday. So we are good. Okay, good luck with yours.

**(6:12 - 6:32):**
And the last point is that you do not only have one slot regarding the LOI. If you ask either to be weekly coordinator every month, you need to put like four if it is every eight weeks. So just manage, it's not only putting one slot, it's about like what you have written in your LOI.

**(6:33 - 6:35):**
Thank you everyone, and bye-bye.
