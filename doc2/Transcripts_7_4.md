### 7.4 Notify telescope teams and Observation plan


**(00:00 intro)**
Hello everyone, so today we're going to talk about step 2, so notify. Last time we talked about the GW alert, one we're going to observe in GRANDMA, which type of alert, and today we're going to show how to notify the telescopes and how to produce the plan. So first I would like to come back about the gravitational wave area.

**(00:29 GW skymap: 90 c.r)**
So here you have, for example, the sky, and LIGO-VIRGO gives a 90% credible area here in black. A 90% credible area or 90% credible region of the sky map is the fact that in this area over the sky, there is 90% of chance that the source is located within this region, and there is 10% of the chance that the source is finally not in this region. So 90% area means that there is a control that defines the 90% of chance that the source is within this area.
50% credible region for the sky map, it means that there is 50% of the chance that the source is within this area, and 50% outside. So the sky map is just like the area of the sky, delimited by a certain confidence number. So remember after last time, after last courses, so we said that we can observe with GRANDMA BNS and NSBH events, when the event is located below 200 MPS, and for an area of the 90% credible region within 200°², so which means that this area, 90% credible region, is less than 200°².
So imagine that this region is several dozen of degrees squared, 100 or 200°², so you cannot point with one telescope something. 

**(00:29 GW skymap: 90 c.r)**
So that's why we will pave the sky, so this is again in black my 90% credible area in control, and we're going to pave the sky, so we have a wide field of view, this is a field of view from a telescope, this is a field of view from another telescope, all the telescopes, they don't have the same field of view, and we're going to pave the sky with all our telescopes in GRANDMA So for example, let's see TCR, which is from the TARO collaboration, it will look at this region of the sky, so we just take a picture from this region here, and then another picture here, which means that for a gravitational alert, we don't give only one pointing, but several pointing, for example, several pointing for this one and this one.
And for FRAM, so another telescope within GRANDMA, it will observe that region, that region, that region, so that we will cover all the sky map. So for the wide field of view, we're able to rapidly pave the sky map, the 90% credible region, but when you have a smaller field of view, you cannot pave because it's going to take a lot of time. That's why we give some interesting galaxies to observe, so here in red, I'm putting red in my picture, for example, giving pointing to SHAO, and this is what we call galaxy targeting compared to tiling.And so then we will fix on region, on galaxies that are located at a distance given by the gravitational wave alert. 
(04:08 Observation plan)
So here, when we talk about giving the observation plan to the telescope's team, it's, for example, galaxy at a certain distance, sorry, and different pointing, which means that if me, I am in SHAO team, and my friend in FRAM and I won't receive, sorry, the same plan with SHAO and with LEMAC. So which means as a follow-up advocate, you need to be very long, but because it's not like GRB or Kilonova, SHAO team, this telescope will receive different targets, so not only one, one, two, three, and LEMAC will receive another type of target.
So when someone said to you, give me the list, you need to provide the corresponding list according to the telescopes, okay? 

**(05:06 Tiling and galaxy targeting)**
So now I would like to give a bit some lessons. So I think you got it. So we have one strategy, which is tiling, and the other one, which is, sorry, galaxy targeting.
Maybe it's like this, because the camera is not standing. Okay, so tiling and galaxy targeting. So once more, oops, tiling and galaxy targeting.
This is not the same strategy. 

**(05:41 Tiling)**
So for the tiling, we have a few telescopes in GRANDMA, quite a number. So we have the TARO collaboration with TCH, TRO, and TCA. They come from TARO. One good news is that when the gravitational wave comes, and we are in the criteria that we saw last time, the plan is sent automatically. So as a follow-up advocate, you just need to check if in Sky Portal, TARO is observing or there is something wrong. We have another group that is called FRAM. So I will write it so that you get, you remember. So FRAM got two telescopes. Again, they are going to observe automatically, so you don't need to do anything unless there is something wrong. For example, you don't see any tiling, any tides, any pointing in Sky Portal, so you can come back, Sergey. For this TARO, you can contact Alain, Alain Klotz, or me, so the PI or the co-PI.
And then we have also access to other facilities. I won't talk about ZTF for the moment. Let's talk to OAG or CFHT. They are wide fields. They can do tiling, but we have only very few time. That's why if there is very interesting alert, discuss with the weekly coordinator.
Maybe we will activate observation with OAG or observation with CFHT. CFHT is me, OIG is Antonio. So if your weekly coordinator thinks that it's very important to observe, then we will compute.
In fact, the plan is already computed, but we will send this back to OAG and CFHT telescopes. So I hope that you listen to me, because this is the tiling, tiling telescopes.

**(07:46 Galaxy Targeting)**
 Now, about the galaxy targeting. So there are many telescopes in GRANDMA that can do galaxy targeting. The narrow field of view, so below 1° square, that they will observe if the gravitational wave is below 200° square. And so the list is a lot of telescopes.
So the list is a lot of telescopes as LEMAC. And here, your job as follow-up advocate is really to make sure that the team, they have understood to point, because it's not automatic. They won't perform, most of them, they won't receive the alert and the telescope will point automatically.
You need to make sure that they have received their list of targets, because remember, it's not one unique list of targets, it's several lists of targets. So you need to make sure that, for example, that you need to observe pointing 1 and 3, and, for example, LEMAC pointing 2 and 4. So this is your job. 

**(08:50 Notify)**
So that's why we come back to your job, which is notify. And for the tiling, it's mostly to check if TARO and FRAM are starting the follow-up, or in case of interesting, notify Antonio and I to make some dedicated follow-up. For the galaxy targeting, here is more, you need to engage more, because you need to notify the team, make sure that they have understood that they will be, they have well received their plan. And now, in the second part of this video, we're going to see in Skyportal and in Slack and in OwnCloud how to receive this plan. So gravitational alert. 

**(09:45 Slack obs plan)**
So remember, let's look at this channel, gravitational alert. So remember on lesson 1, you had this GW candidate coming.
We tried to understand all these parameters. And after a while, so you see the alert was received at 8.05 for my local time. And after a while, you will receive this message connected to, for example, 23.01.11 CP.
So three minutes, sometimes it's 10 minutes. Okay, so don't worry, you need to really wait for. And this is tiling.
So we talk about tiling. And here you can see that the telescopes for which the plan has been computed. So 20 fields, which means that we will give them 20 observations to do.
And it corresponds to 40%, for example, for TCH of the credible region, for TRO 27% of the credible region, FSU Auger 12%, and TCA only 1%, and FSU only 5%. 

**(10:56 tiling joint area)**
So if you make the sum of all the percentage that they contain the sources, in fact, you arrive to a probability area of 70% for a total of coverage of the sky of 487 degrees square. So this is quite good.

**(11:31 galaxy targeting slack)**
And also because we can compute this, for example, I give an example about computation of the galaxy targeting. So we will also receive a message. So here I just put one telescope for the test, but you can also receive all the fields.
So remember here at the center of each field, there is the galaxy. Compared to here, there is nothing about galaxy. I think you get it.
(12:07 report on skyportal)
So now I will go to Skyportal. So you will receive the alert in Skyportal. Okay, so this is Skyportal.
Imagine that this is the event. And what you need to do is to go to social and say, so I receive, for example, the alert on Slack, plans produce for yada yada. And then you check like, this is a comment.
And then you receive, you can say like, TCA, hey, as observed, et cetera, et cetera, to make sure that all the things that you have written previously in the logbook will be captured in Skyportal. 

**(13:17 owncloud intro)**
So now I go to, I come back to this gravitational alert. So I go to our enclose.
So you need to have access to enclose. I go, for example, to candidates. So now GW, this is 11 CP.
Sorry, I am a bit ill. And we're going to explore the different folders of OwnCloud because we need to check that. So for example, you have a real event. 

**(13:56 vo events)**
So I will make maybe a video about it. But this is preliminary one because remember that we are at preliminary one here in my example. Sorry.
So we are at preliminary run and you can see, in fact, the message that were sent to the different telescopes automatically. So this is really for automatic telescopes. In this preliminary, you can see, in fact, the different pointing provided to the telescopes.

**(14:36 gwemopt and txt plans)**
So what is interesting is to go to GWEMOPT for you. I go to preliminary. So we have different two type of plans.
This is where we can see the plan. So I go to tiling. And again, you have, in fact, the pointing given to the different telescopes.
So here is TCH. It is called TCH, right? There is 20 fields. Oh, yeah, because remember we said that we are going to give 20 fields.
And so this is the tile ID. So the tile within Skyportal. The ranking, 1, 2, 3. So sometimes the telescopes, they will give you this number or this number.
In Skyportal, I think this is more this number. And then this is the coordinates given to a telescope and the probability. So the ranking.
So you see, the first one has more probabilities than the last one. And so if someone asks you the plan, here it is. It is in the name of the gravitational alert, GWEMOPT, the type of the alert, and tiling. So if someone asks you are the tile and there are different alerts, for example, we are already at the initial. You don't provide preliminary. You give the observation plan corresponding to the most updated sky map.
Okay? So, I mean, it sounds reasonable. So for the galaxy, sorry, for the other teams, for example, for the galaxy targeting. So here in NEMAC, again, you can give if the telescopes team doesn't know where is the plan.
And to help them, we can give this coordinate. So you need to observe that and that and that, et cetera, et cetera. So this is the plan to give to the telescopes team.

**(16:39 provide assistance teams)**
What you need to do, as always, is to go to #observation, say, Hi, we have received an alert. And then, so hi, we have hi channel. We have received an alert.
And then, you contact the team regarding if it is night or not. So to determine if it is night or not. So you look at this plan.

**(17:09 skyportal visibility telescopes)**
You know, I have a map. And you can see that VIRT, OPD, TCH, PRAM, et cetera, they can observe right now. So you will first bother them because it is now this team.
And it is important in Sky Portal, in here, to say, I have contacted nananinanana teams. Because for the next shifter, he will contact the one when it is nighttime. You know, so we don't contact all the team when it is daytime.
Remember, we contact them two hours before it is nighttime. So with Sky Portal, it will really help you to understand which team are during night and daytime. Let me remember what I need to say to you. I think it's done.

**(18:17 skymap plot)**
 So I'm just coming back here. Because in Tiling, for example, there is plots.
And there are interesting plots. So for example, type coverage, EMT mock. You can see, in fact, the probabilities, the sky map.
And you can see the different tilings, what it gives you. So for example, you can see over time which one contributes regarding the pointing. And you can see that it's very joint.
So for example, here, TAO you know, observe some tile, whereas the others are observing something else. So you can check, for example, to understand better the plan about these different plots that you have on the cloud. To understand better what it is going on.
So in case that you are lost, you need to contact your coordinator. And this is it. 

**(19:23 bye)**
So thank you to have listened to me.
And I will make an exercise for you straight away. Thank you.
